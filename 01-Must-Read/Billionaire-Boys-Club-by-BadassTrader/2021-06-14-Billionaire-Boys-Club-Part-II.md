Ok, you apes got me all riled up now after the positive reaction to my last post ([Ref Boys Club Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzkzi5/is_this_the_final_boss_john_petry_and_ken_griffin/)) so I've decided to keep digging.

Let's start with Our New Super Villian Michael "Milky" Milken:

[![r/Superstonk - Billionaire's Boys Club - Part 2: The Inner Circle](https://preview.redd.it/7li64nzrk9571.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcde810dc36c5dda25784896d52d37d983b9dcb)](https://preview.redd.it/7li64nzrk9571.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bcde810dc36c5dda25784896d52d37d983b9dcb)

Disclaimer: I'm Irish and have no real interest in American pol itics, so I know once I mention this shit's gonna get political, but lets try and not...

We're all Apes, we're all here for the Stonk... not for Poli tics.

So... TR UMP pardoned this guy on 18th Feb 2020.

What struck me about this, was that he had 33 people lobbying Tr ump to get his Pardon. ([Ref New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/michael-milken-trump-pardon.html))

Now, when you click on the link to get the White Houses statement on who these 33 people are, it brings up a 404 error... The statement no longer exists!

But luckily, this Ape has heard of the way back machine!

So using the way back machine, we can get the 33 names. ([Ref Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200313203638/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-2/))

So fuck me Apes...

This guy has some friend list willing to go to bat for him right?

Can't even count the amount of Billionaires up there and this is just the list of people issued in the official Whitehouse statement (That mysteriously no longer exists)

So... on with the connections.

Let's cross-reference our hedgies with our favorite stonk.

John Paulson Hedgie #1 - Does not have a position in GME according to latest 13F.

Neither does Hedgie #2, though he does have a small up of a million shares on AMC

How about our investment firms?

Josh Harris at Apollo Global Management decided in Q1 of 2021 that he would trade GME for the first time with a small put position of 150,000 Shares. ([Ref Holdings](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/apollo-management-holdings-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link)) - Similar Timing to Sessa Maybe?

But other than that... not a whole load more to report.

How about connections to Kenny Himself?

Well there's a SHITLOAD of that...

Here's just 1 article, referencing 6 of our 33 hitlist in addition to Kenny himself referencing donations to the Repu blican party. (Again... I'll try keep po litics out of this, but this is establishing connections)

[Reference Forbes Article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/windriver/2021/05/07/open-source-brings-collective-creativity-to-the-intelligent-edge/?sh=7f6db7ab321a)

(Can you spot all 6?)

I'm not going to go through ALL of it as there is WAY too much, but it's safe to say... there are a lot of connections

But here are a few examples to wet your confirmation bias...

[Elaine Chao and Kenny hanging out at a Milken event with "The worlds most powerful thinkers"](https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-milken-conference-trump-idCAKBN17Y26U-OCABS)

[Kenny, David Rubenstein, Mark Weinberger, Steven Tananbaum all hanging out at the Milken Global Conference in 2017](https://milkeninstitute.org/events/global-conference-2017/speakers)

[Kenny buys Rupert Murdochs ex Wife's House](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/residential-real-estate/what-will-billionaire-ken-griffin-build-his-huge-palm-beach-estate)

(Can't make this shit up)

+ This Milken Institute seems to be central for a lot of these guys...

ANYWAY....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On to the shit we care about.

We've established that there's a Billionaires Boys Club and Kenny is Part of it.

So let's take the Sessa and Apollo pattern and see if we can expand on it.

What are we looking for?

Companies that own Puts, that first reported ownership in Q1 2021 and that have not hedged.

This gives us this list:

Taconic Capital Advisors: 537,900 shares valued at $102 million

Hound Partners LLC: 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million

CMT Capital Markets Trading: 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million (Sounds familiar)

Millennium Management LLC: 163,400 shares valued at $31 million

Apollo Management Holdings: 150,000 shares valued at $28.5 million (We know who this is)

CSS LLC: 71,000 Shares valued at $13.5 million

Jefferies Group LLC: 48,000 shares valued at $9 million (Jefferies? WTF)

Ionic Capital Management: 20,600 shares valued at $4million

There's more... but that's enough for now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second biggest NEW put position is Taconic Capital

Founder of Taconic, is Frank Brosens.

Frank Brosens was invited to speak at the Invest for Kids Event in Chicago...

As was Kenny

As was Milken

Reference: [Invest for Kids Event Speakers list](https://investforkidschicago.org/past-speakers/)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd biggest NEW position without a hedge falls to Hound Partners

Couldn't dig up a lot here except this suspiciously convenient article about Kenny having a CURIOUSLY passive stake in TiVo along with Hound Partners, both in a stock that is "Not exactly widely followed"

<https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo>

On the OTHER HAND...

(This shit gets crazy)

Hound Partners was funded by a company called Tiger Management.

Tiger Management was founded by Julian Robertson

And... I really can't believe I am saying this but...

Kenny's Ex-wife, Anne Dias, Managed Money for both Kenny and Julian Robertson!!!!

WTF... THE ACTUAL FUCK

Reference: <https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201>

I don't subscribe to WSJ, so only reading the headline... LMFAO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up to get knocked down...

Millenium Management Company Run by Israel Englander

Again... a suspiciously convenient example of Citadel and Millennium working in parallel with each other dumping FireEye Shares.

Reference (Warning... this is a motley fool article. Proceed with Skeptisism. [Link)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/these-billionaires-just-dumped-more-than-1-million.aspx)

And yet again... Milken Global Conference 2010 with Milken, Kenny and Englander

<https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apollo we already discussed.

But another cross-referencing showed up this article that has Marc Rowan (Apollo Founder), Kenny AND Julian Robertson all donating to Mitt Romney

<https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/02/01/billionaires-private-equity-ceos-give-big-to-romney-super-pac/?sh=5a6b52443568>

And more form the Apollo leadership team heading out to hang out with Milken and Kenny in 2015: <https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSS LLC was a much tougher nut to crack.

Smaller company. Smaller position.

Finra does have a check on them though ([Ref: LINK](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/45980))

And it shows a single Director: Peter Anthony Ianello

After doing some solid Googling, it turns out he goes by Peter Ianello and is actually the founder of a different company... OCA Ventures.

I searched them for a 13F, but doesn't exist. (Ref: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc>)

But they are out of Chicago and both Kenny and Peter made it to the Chicago 100 list:

<http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html>

A cross-reference with Milken shows that both guys are listed as business speakers for events... but that's meh...

That's all I could get for this one... but I am even more suspicious of these smaller funds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ionic Capital Management was a hard nut too

Founders were not listed in Linkedin, but I found [an article](https://www.globalvolatilitysummit.com/sponsor/ionic/) listing 3 Co-Founders for the company:

Bart Baum

Adam Radosti

Daniel Stone

YET AGAIN... another article talking about Kenny and one of these companies making unusual plays.

Here they talk about Citadel And Ionic (Specifically just these 2) being bullish on a company called Verb. -- ONLY 4 hedge funds in total were trading this company!!!

Ken created the largest position and Ionic had the highest weighting.

And weirdly... in the article... it says both companies had $0 million as their position. lol. WTF.

Reference: <https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-technology-company-inc-verb/>

And here... Millenium, Citadel and Ionic all mentioned in a poorly timed position in LATAM Airlines

<https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/>

Another unusual trade in NASDAQ:AVCT mentioning Citadel, Ionic and Millenium...

<https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/>

Another unusual trade for NASDAQ:GSMG mentioning Citadel, Ionic and Millenium...

<https://topnasdaq.com/is-gsmg-a-good-stock-to-buy-now/>

This list goes on... but I think you get the picture...

Been writing and researching this for a good few hours now, so I hope you find some entertainment in it.

I think the point is clear... and something we all knew all along.

There is 100% a Billionaire's Boys Club... but it's still fun to connect some of the dots!

EDIT: Part 3 on the way... Let's get a little more solid in the connections this time.
