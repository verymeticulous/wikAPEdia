Ok... time to get serious.

Who's getting heavy into Short Positions besides Citadel?

We already spoke about the Sessa YOLO, but not to worry... we'll circle back on these puppets.

Another big mover...

Cisco

So these guys have owned GME previously, but since their last 13F, have increased that position by 1,264,700 shares of PUTS.

Meaning... that's more than a 10,000% increase in their position.

Remember my first DD that started me down this rabbit hole?

[(Check it out here if not)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nyt6l8/wrinkle_brains_needed_citadel_loading_up_on_high/)

But that was focused on the junk bonds and particularly $HYG

Well give a guess who else is HEAVY on $HYG PUTS?

Yup... Our boys at Prelude.

Reference: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/springbok-capital-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link>

They own 531,000 shares of PUTS in this junk bond worth $46 million and making up 1.19% of their portfolio after increasing their position by 151%.

ADDITIONALLY...

They own 450,865 shares of the stock itself.

Now you may think this is just a hedge, but they added 419,906 of these shares since their last filing. (An increase of 1,356%)

So what's interesting about this???

Well the top position in these guys portfolio is SPY (PUTS) - 863,100 shares valued at $342,072,000

And... in at 7th position they have QQQ (PUT) at 173,100 shares valued at $55.5 million

So they're betting that the market is going to crash and they are jumping into GME and HYG Puts.

(Funnily enough, Citdel's largest position is also SPY (PUTS) at 6.2% of their portfolio with 63.8million shares valued at $25 Billion)

Both Companies have hedged against this, but both companies are betting the market is going down and are jumping to bonds.

So we all know Citadel's relationship with GME, but why if this company knows EVERYTHING that Citadel seems to know, would they increase their PUTS on GME by 10,000%? UNLESS... they are helping?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And this HYG seems to be the lifeboat Apes. Look at the increase of the BIG BOYS jumping on HYG PUTS:

(See Taconic in there right at the end too?)

Jane Street has HYG in their top 10 after increasing the PUTS by 150%!

(Interestingly Jane Street are decreasing their SPY PUTS and Increasing their SPY CALLS)

- But lets get back on topic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Who else is jumping on the HYG Bandwagon?

How about Ares Management? A Brand New Position with 2 million shares valued at $174 million and their 4th largest position?

Ref: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ares-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link>

How about Jefferies Group? 1,342,700 HYG (PUTS) valued at $117 million and their 13th largest position. (They also have their top position in SPY(PUTS) - 2,435,608 million shares valued at $965 million. And QQQ(PUT) at 2.3 million shares valued at $759 million.

Ref: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/jefferies-group-inc-de#tabholdings_tab_link>

How about GoldenTree Assets? Buying the underlying stock this time, and actually decreasing it's position but still at 1,150,000 shares valued at $100 million and their 6th largest position. (You may remember these guys from Billionaires Boys Club Part 2, who also have a large PUT position in AMC)

Ref: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/goldentree-asset-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link>

How about Blackstone Group? Brand new position opened up (Late to the party) HYG (PUT) 100,000 shares at $8.7 million value. These guys also have SPY (PUT) at 9,084,800 valued at $3.8 Billion as their 4th largest position. +QQQ Puts at $2.1 Billion at 5th position

Ref: <https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackstone-group-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link>

All of these companies seem to be making SIMILAR moves. Not identical by any means, and I'm sure there are lots of differences.

But the moves also similar to Citadels Moves.

I mean FFS... They are ALL saying the market is about to CRASH! Including Citadel!

And are we READY FOR THE BOMB DROP?

What do all of these companies have in Common?

They are ALL run by Drexel Burnham Lambert Alumni!!

Yup... He's at the center of it again!
