Hey Everyone!

What a fucking few days hey? GME closes almost 15% up, streamers that are more interested in their weird tarot card readings than actual data, FUD that we can barely even spot anymore, and an IV increase that is being hidden by a hidden company none of us have even talked about. Wait... what was that last part? Oh yeah haha, another fucking DTCC that we have all neglected or overlooked or just got buried somewhere. Here it is, another banker filled board that oversees ALL OPTION CLEARING DATA.

No, I am not fucking around - it is stated on their website:

<https://www.theocc.com/>

The mother fucking OCC.

The largest derivatives clearing organization. Stability. Integrity. Overseen by the SEC and CFTC. Major OTC clearing for options.

Who might want to clear options OTC to maintain a free market that doesn't drown them?

How about banks and institutions who accepted these giant fucking pile of dog shit option contracts from market makers who are hedging bets and cut off buying/selling in Jan?

1.  Chairman - One of the most influential people in finance (knows Chicago trade and mergers origins).

2.  Managing Director, Head of Americas Asset Management Services, Bank of America - Literally still works for BoA, previously Morgan Stanley. What a fucking conflict considering what is currently going on between apes and the fact that BoA holds shares and puts on GME, and we have successfully proved the data is being manipulated (Ill come back to more on manipulation through these guys).

3.  Founding Member - Literally has worked for BoA, Goldmans, Morgan Stanley. Probably one of the geniuses behind this since he's the tech guy.

4.  Partner and Head of Market Structure, Wolverine Trading - DONT THESE GUYS HOLD A VERY LARGE, UNHEDGED PUT POSITION ON GME?!?! WHAT IN THE FLYING FUCK IS GOING ON?!

5.  Executive Vice President & CIO, Interactive Brokers, LLC - DIDNT THESE GUYS HALT FUCKING TRADING TO GME IN JAN???? WE FUCKING KNOW THEY DID.

6.  Managing Director, General Counsel Department at Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC - Oh another banker overseeing the largest derivatives clearing corp, when the banks are currently going through a liquidity crisis.

7.  Vice Chairman, NASDAQ Inc. - I actually think the NASDAQ is probably the free and fair market we are looking for. I have no comment.

8.  Chief Strategy Officer, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. - Seriously. This is getting tedious. CSO. ICE which owns NYSE. Oh, and represents them on the DTCC board. Lol fuck me, right? But retail is definitely the problem.

9.  Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Cboe Global Markets - No issue with this guy. I actually think the CBOE Bats thing might be beneficial to us. But that is another DD.

10. Senior Vice President - Head of Product Management for North American Market Services, NASDAQ Inc. - Ex Goldman-Sachs guy. Obviously.

11. Senior Vice President - Head of Product Management for North American Market Services, NASDAQ Inc. - Just another individual investor exchange board member. TD Ameritrade (didn't they do some shady shit?). Anyway.

12. Chief Regulatory Officer, Intercontinental Exchange & General Counsel, NYSE Group - Oh look, another ICE/NYSE lawyer, which has let Citadel and friends run the show on the NYSE, especially GME.

13. Former Financial Executive - Meh no issues she seems to have been just a hard nosed finance person. Unless someone wants to dig in more, no complaints, just a derivative guru.

14. Managing Partner, Windham Capital Management Inc. - Oh look, an ex Bear Sterns PRESIDENT. Curious how he made out after the crash and I would be even more curious about his insider trading reports for Bear.

15. Chairman, Risk Committee, Kepos Capital LP - Oh look, an ex Goldman Sachs partner. Again...

16. General Counsel, Citadel Securities - My fucking favorite board member on the list. This is pretty much self explanatory. Oh, and a FINRA grad.

17. Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of DASH Financial Technologies - Meh. Nothing crazy. Has a vested interest in OTC markets for large institutions.

18. Managing Director and Global Head of CCP Strategy and Resource Optimization, Morgan Stanley - Literally works at Morgan Stanley

19. Economist - Ex Federal Reserve person. Regulated OTC derivatives market.

There you go. That is the start of how the system has be built to keep the wealthy, well, wealthy. And what I am going to conclude from the next bit should really show how they're bending the fucking rules to make sure this doesn't cause too much of a ripple (in my opinion - this is how I cope in case they decide to fuck it all over again and say "well retards it went to $x is that not enough? Greedy apes").

I said once, derivatives and options surrounding GME have become the main issue. This is how they are balancing their books to avoid margin calls through their lenders (I.E. Goldmans, Morgan, BoA, get the idea here of *how and why*?) They are purposefully changing the math, and I think I can prove it, right now.

NYSE OPTIONS CONTRACTS

I found the mapping data for the NYSEArca contracts and it has some interesting data. They don't even consolidate the option data until 5pm the next business day. Which means it is 100% probable that the OTC trades take over for deals to settle option contracts for large financial institutions the next day. And the lights are most likely on because they are making phone call after phone call trying to run their quants and figure out what they can trade for some moon tickets. This means that these guys are trading on the back end, in bulk, being overseen by our new favorite board of bankers and lawyers.

Ive been cross referencing the ArcaAmex data with the OCC data, because on OCC you can actually check option data (which seems awesome because you would think the main derivative clearing corp would have up to date info). And there is definitely some weird data coming from the OCC.

<https://preview.redd.it/6hkc2jbfyrz61.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=c437168f9d1cad8b2663d52847586eda0a97db92>

0 OI for GME May 14 Calls (all in the money in this case).

0 OI for GME May 14 Puts (all in the money).

Ok but ok. Maybe they dont update it. But the May 21 Calls are there...

Ok... And before you say these arent sourced from everywhere:

<https://preview.redd.it/qqluvrv2zrz61.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e87312e800ff73309689899b93f3efaed9cd71>

The info is here <https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Series-Search?symbol=gme&symbolType=Options>

These should literally be updated daily. And depending on who's buying and paying attention, there should definitely be some movement. But anyway, lets go look at TODAYS data for May 21 GME options, through the company that OCC links all their derivative data through.

<https://oic.ivolatility.com/oic_adv_options.j;jsessionid=a-dh_HwzV6lh>

<https://preview.redd.it/iwi1zukvzrz61.png?width=1905&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5d5a158b26d1831c2170a8ecc8fb48fa8a2db88>

Notice anything weird about the IV? And the cost of the option vs the strike price? Literally the Deep In The Money calls mean worth is the exact same cost as a share. And we know that everything about "free and fair market" in the last little while has been about "taking the best average cost at market value for our clients" (my broker touts this - I assume most do).

And the IV is significantly lower than what other sources are saying. Barchart has $10 calls at 1600% IV, yahoo same thing. Odd that this data is almost purposefully deflating the IV of GME, considering after the last massive increase in IV was Jan. No, seriously:

<https://preview.redd.it/6ro04put0sz61.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1e601fc6c657a49ec675ced38e8852f81917ed>

And if we go back to the NYSE Arca data, the consolidated short interest changes with how many shares are short as well. Check this out, I am only going to go to the end of Jan because there is a ton of data, but maybe Ill do the rest after to prove their algo is betting against retail. Because they only changed it once WSB reallyyy started to get into GME mid January. And they didn't expect the upward buy pressure, so they manipulated the market through the OCC to make this work in their favor.

The short volume literally started to MIMIC THE FUCKING BUY VOLUME AFTER MID JAN. HOLY FUCKING PYRAMID SCHEME BATMAN.

I said it before, and I personally think this definitively concludes that the banks, shitadel and other hedge funds, and the regulatory bodies like the OCC are working against us through algos, reddit scraping, and OTC. Thanks for attending the fucking TedTalk. I hope we can all buy and hold more. Not financial advice. Just an ape who wants tendies from these people who have made a fortune off our hard work and lower class lifestyle. Buckle up hodl, and dont forget your hellmits.
