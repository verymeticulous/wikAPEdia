Happy Easter Apes,

The folks at PHLX are back at it again with massive DEEP ITM call purchases before close

GME Biggest Trades 4-4-2021

As you can see from the data above a buyer out of PHLX bought $106 million of these DEEP ITM calls at 1:22pm and 3:29pm totaling 5960 calls at assorted strike prices ($12-20). These is a pretty massive purchase and it is my belief they made be using these to hide FTD's (Failed-to-deliver). These all expire 4/16/2021 leading me to believe the next few weeks we will see heightened volatility as we near the quarter's hottest expiry date (4/16). With some potential major catalysts looming things are definitely getting pretty spicy.
