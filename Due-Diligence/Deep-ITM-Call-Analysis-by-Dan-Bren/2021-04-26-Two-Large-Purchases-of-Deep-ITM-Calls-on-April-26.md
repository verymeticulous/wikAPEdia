Good Afternoon Apes,

Sorry for no post last Friday but everyone needs an off day once in awhile. I will dump that data below today's info. First, WHO HAD A GREAT MONDAY? I know I chomped down a couple celebratory crayons at work. Love to see some green always good for the morale.

There were two large block purchases of DEEP ITM calls today at the same time (3:18pm) out of PHLX (Philadelphia): 400 of the $15 calls with expiration 4/30/21 and 280 of the $5 calls expiring 1/20/23. If these were all purchased (i.e. none were sold) this would amount to a $10,758,800 transaction.

I'm curious if we will see another large wave of these appearing this week and historically some of the largest purchases of these DEEP ITM calls has occurred on Wednesdays and Fridays. It will be interesting to see how things shape up this week and my TITS ARE JACKED to say the least.

Here is the data from last Friday as well, as you can see there were no large block purchases of DEEP ITM calls.

See you all tomorrow if my wife's boyfriend lets me use the computer.

Edit: Forgot to mention there were some ITM puts bought out of ISE on Friday. Don't really know what to make of these yet but I will continue to monitor the data and see if they reappear.
