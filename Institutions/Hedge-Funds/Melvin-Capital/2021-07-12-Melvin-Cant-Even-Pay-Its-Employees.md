*"Melvin Capital Management, which lost more than $6 billion in January, is now down 46% for the year through June, the fund recently told investors. Maplelane Capital is down 39% for the period. Some other funds that sustained lesser losses in the January meme-stock surge are doing better. Steven A. Cohen's $22 billion Point72 Asset Management and the $20 billion D1 Capital Partners are up about 1% and 3.8% for the first half of the year, respectively, said people familiar with the funds' performance."*

*"Melvin now says it lost 54.5% in January, more than its 53% estimate at the time, said people familiar with the firm. Maplelane lost about 45% that month."*

"Both funds have since raised new money on which they can charge management and performance fees, helping to pay their employees until they make up losses."
