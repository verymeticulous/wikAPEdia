I realize this might be bumping up against Rule 5 since it's kind of removed from $GME, but bear with me because I think this is something we should all be aware of and which may have a huge impact on the epilogue of the MOASS saga. Now, I don't know anything about finance, so I usually just lurk, reading DD and confirming my bias. But I *do* know about the law and I think I happen to find myself in middle of a Venn-diagram you apes might find interesting. That being the Manhattan District Attorney Race.

We've all seen the legal and regulatory walls closing in on the hedgies lately. They're working through the night doing... what exactly? There doesn't seem to be a way out, so why bother moving chairs on the titanic? Suppose for argument's sake that the point is to buy time to shield assets from the eventual bankruptcy of these funds. Certainly isn't hard to imagine, you can bet these people already move their money to avoid scrutiny or taxes, this is no different. But the issue is that even if you were to somehow protect your entire fortune, it means nothing when you land in prison.

So what do rich people do to avoid paying for their crimes? They buy politicians! And who is Citadel's politician of choice? I present to you: Tali Farhadian Weinstein.

That's Kenny G himself and Pablo Salame, the head of global credit at Citadel donating to Ms. Weinstein ($35,000 is the statutory maximum you can give). Bear in mind, Kenny G has donated over 100 million to the GOP over the past few years, he's donated hundreds of thousands to republicans in NY state races, so why is he donating to a democrat in a county primary? The Manhattan District Attorney is a unique position to prosecute financial crimes, they have jurisdiction over Wall Street. The more interesting question, though, is why Tali Weinstein?

Tali Weinstein is the wife of [Boaz Weinstein](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m3lx01dnj9mq/Boaz-Weinstein-Is-Making-Bank-He-s-Not-Happy-That-You-Know-About-It), founder and manager of Saba Capital. The couple lives in a $25.5 million apartment. It is very clear from the vast amounts of money she's raising that she if very close with the ultrawealthy and is aptly named [Wall Street's Chosen Candidate](https://gothamist.com/news/wall-street-has-chosen-its-candidate-heated-race-district-attorney-tali-farhadian-weinstein).

Lest you think these rich people are funding her because of her qualifications, it's worth noting Weinstein has "[never practiced [law] in Manhattan](https://www.5bd.org/tali-farhadian-weinstein/)" and has "[significant gaps in her understanding](https://www.5bd.org/tali-farhadian-weinstein/)" of the issues faced by a Manhattan DA. She's running as a democrat, but only [registered as one](https://twitter.com/SamMellins/status/1400076074810327040) in 2017 and has never voted in an election for D.A., or even mayor (she will actually be the first county official she votes for). And, of course, she was courted by [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/nyregion/manhattan-district-attorney-trump.html) to become a judge, so that tells you all you need to know about her Democrat credentials.

The point of all of this is there are going to be a lot of very wealthy people in some legal hot water in the next couple of months, and the Manhattan District Attorney is going to be one of the few people who can actually turn up the heat on them. For *some unknown reason,* though, those ultrawealthy people have all chosen an unqualified, Trump-aligned, ultra-wealthy candidate to shower with their unprecedented support.

So, BUY, HODL, VOTE.

And if you're a Manhattan ape, make sure you also VOTE in the primaries on 6/22!

EDIT TO ADD:

TL;DR: Citadel is contributing big $$$ to a NY DA candidate. The candidate has no prior experience or extensive knowledge that should be had with this position. She is closely connected to extreme wealth and if elected would be the one with power to hold these criminals feet to the fire. (thanks, [u/bloodshot_blinkers](https://www.reddit.com/u/bloodshot_blinkers/))

EDIT 2:

Taking [u/EmoeyJoey](https://www.reddit.com/u/EmoeyJoey/)'s suggestion and adding for those of you wondering what to do about this: if you're in Manhattan, vote in the primaries . If you know anyone in Manhattan, encourage them to vote. Consider donating to Weinstein's opponents. Don't take my word for it, but being a prosecutor myself and having obsessed over that list of donors for a long time, I think Eliza Orlins is the one for the job. Her campaign is entirely grassroots, she's not in the pocket of the wealthy. I've actually been volunteering for her campaign as a result (full disclosure in case you look me up and think this was all a paid ad or something)

And of course, get ready to raise hell post MOASS if Tali wins.
