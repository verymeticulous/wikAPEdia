EDIT(3/5/21): Foreword to my edit: I still think, that the Squeeze happens in the timespan I stated (between march 15th and march 19th). I found a lot more catalysts, that I talked about in the livestreams I list down below. I am actually more confident than ever, that I was infact right with the date. I talk about the AI, even many more catalysts, that I didn't talk about here, the XRT and why it's not the dividens, but the rebalance that's important. If you want to know more about my thoughts on all of this and want a better explanation, I can recommend watching it.

I responded to a lot of questions and critique in 2 Livestreams on YouTube:

1.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32f9CPxGW10&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32f9CPxGW10&t=4s)

2.  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Vc-irYsL4&>

I am going to finish my break and will respond to more questions regarding my thoughts and this DD in a Livestream or Video of my own!

More catalysts that I talked about in the Livestreams and that I am also going to talk about in my own Videos/Streams:

-   EDIT 03/13: The State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) is rebalancing on March 19th (<https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51>)

-   EDIT 03/13: 401k's are moving out of Melvin March 18th (<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/>)

-   2\. March 17 at 12:00 PM ET: The full Committee will convene for a virtual hearing entitled, "Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, Part II." <https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407261>

-   3\. Ryan Cohen will become CEO at the end of march (probably march 25th)(theory)

-   4\. Gamestop Shares callback early april (not confirmed yet!)

-   5\. Maybe an emergency meeting, therefore another share callback (theory)

-   6\. XRT Rebalance, they will probably throw out GME (theory, but that would force the shorts to cover all positions in XRT on that day)

-   7\. Like I stated in my first DDs, there are whales going for the really long play, therefore there is a lot of buying pressure from even more sides now, causing the price to keep spiking up, that's what we are seeing at the moment

-   8\. Option chains get more massive by every week, more and more options become ITM and cause little gamma squeezes almost every few days, until a big one comes and the rocket lifts off

-   9\. Gamestop will probably acquire SLG (Super League Gaming)

TL;DR / TL;DW: We have around 12 - 15 catalysts for my predicted date. Making it almost impossible to weasle out and therefore making me more confident than ever in my theory.

PS: To all the people saying I went off reddit but kept giving youtube interviews to make money or to attention whore, here is my response (copied from my own comment): Hi. I just want to adress this, because I stumbled over that a lot today. I went on 2 Interviews (one was about 30 minutes long, the other one was about an hour long). Both of these interviews were SOLELY for answering questions regarding my DD. I don't want to plug anyones youtube stream. But I gave people 24hours to collect questions regarding my thoughts and they could ask me literally anything. I tried my best in that one hour interview and even doubled my time on that one (wanted to do 30 minutes initially). I only did the second interview because I felt like a lot of questions were asked within the first 24 hours and as I said, I wanted to answer as many as possible. I am in talk with one of the mods at the moment, because I want to adress the critique in a livestream or a youtube video. I am a slow and bad writer and can express my thoughts much quicker when I am talking. It's easier to add something to your thoughts and elaborate on some things further as well. So please. Give me around a week of a break and then I will answer every question in a stream or a video, that people want me to answer and those I am able to answer. If I am not able to answer a question, I am sorry, but I am not a messiah. I will add questions I am not able to answer to the stream or video as well. But as a PSA: Stop spreading fake information, that I went off reddit and went onto youtube to do a lot of videos or interviews. It was 1.5 hrs of answering questions surrounding the DD over the course of 2 days.

Feel free to gather some questions and I will look forward to answering them! Thank you guys and gals for all the support, kind messages and what not. I appreciate all the support!

Edit2: I accidentally deleted my whole post by adding the first edit, I tried to get it back up, but there might be something missing. If you find anything missing, please tell me. Thx!

Edit3: Because I hit the max. character limit for this post, I had to cut out rensoles foreword and add it here as a screenshot: https:/imgur.com/a/gx3GMst. (rensole helped me with the sources and proof reading. Thank you so much!)

DD Post:

I don't even know how to start this. First of all, I want to add a really important disclaimer. The following DD presented is solely based on research, numbers and data available to the public. I tried to take every single factor out there into account. That doesn't automatically mean, that all of the following has to become true. The following DD is what I THINK is going to happen. There is no guarantee and I am not taking any responsibility for any decisions people make after reading the DD. I let other people check my DD, double and triple read it myself, but there still might be some flaws in logic or errors. If you find any, CALL ME OUT on them! I will either correct or remove them, if there are any. As I said, multiple people proof read this, so there shouldn't be any, but you never know. Now that we've got that sorted out, this is where the fun begins.

Queue Avengers Endgame Theme:

We have to start somewhere, so let's start at some recent events. The first one: The crazy price run-up and the preparation of an options chain on February 24th. What exactly happened?

THE RABBIT HOLE PART I:

To know what happened, it is really important to know, that Gamestop was on the short sale restriction (SSR) list that day. But how did GME get on the SSR in the first place? This is where it's beginning to sound like a conspiracy theory or a fucking masterplan made up by other hedge funds in order to bait out Citadel/Melvin.

Let's take a look at the Data:

On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!

All the data analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/4ivzo181b6l61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e32ed1a1fbfd4eb0851b0a82559791ee30eace3)](https://preview.redd.it/4ivzo181b6l61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e32ed1a1fbfd4eb0851b0a82559791ee30eace3)

[![r/GME - Endgame DD: How last weeks actions all come together to one specific Date. All the data analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/fiseko03b6l61.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=6368f68c4fbb1bf1f3083c4e62fbf507be49865d)](https://preview.redd.it/fiseko03b6l61.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=6368f68c4fbb1bf1f3083c4e62fbf507be49865d)

Nothing special, right? Wrong. The price drop to exactly $40 was created artificially by someone shorting 100,000 shares right at opening.

[![r/GME - Endgame DD: How last weeks actions all come together to one specific Date. All the data analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/b09chl44b6l61.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=6481a4abd3c5e1fae70a27f18faacc8e6c3ea0e2)](https://preview.redd.it/b09chl44b6l61.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=6481a4abd3c5e1fae70a27f18faacc8e6c3ea0e2)

In addition to that, they set off a calculated sell and then closed their short position instantly after hitting the $40 mark. Buying back the shares to cover their position in addition to buying back in (propably by the same institution that shorted and sold off a couple of shares to drive the price down to $40) brought the price back to exactly $44,97 for a second. Notice anything? That is EXACTLY the opening price. So after that 35 minute span of shenanigans we were right back to the opening price and it was like nothing happened to the stock.

But something did happen. Something really important. That quick sell-off and shorting brought the price down by 10 %. That got GME on the SSR for the next day.

[![r/GME - Endgame DD: How last weeks actions all come together to one specific Date. All the data analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/fn8lz4c5b6l61.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=d78facf6d699d1a21a50ef162fe5d47a2aba584f)](https://preview.redd.it/fn8lz4c5b6l61.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=d78facf6d699d1a21a50ef162fe5d47a2aba584f)

Conclusion: Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!

THE RABBIT HOLE PART II:

As I stated in my post on February 24th, I found out, that someone with large amounts of money set up the GME Stock for a Gamma Squeeze. How you may ask? I am gonna quote my own post here, so I don't have to repeat myself:

-----------------------------------------------

MY POST FROM 24THFEB:

So, we have a few hints that institutions jumped in for some fun.

- There are lot of buy orders with 3 to 4 decimals being made, driving the price up bit by bit. That kind of trading is not possible for retail. (<https://imgur.com/a/26y2B8Z>)

- Someone prepared Call-Chains to set up GME for a Gamma Squeeze, possibly starting the short squeeze (<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME>) (Also:<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq5tnh/gme_a_whale_is_setting_up_a_gamma_squeeze_this/>)

- Hedgies shorted GME with 200,000 Shares. That didn't get the price back down to <$50. So what did they do? They shorted it again with 100,000 Shares. That eventually dropped the price to <$50 again. (<https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME>) EDIT: They just shorted another 100,000! That makes 400,000 shares sold short today.

EDIT: ANOTHER FIND: Because GME is on the SSR today, they are not allowed to short on downticks. When GME hit it's 2nd low after reaching the $50 mark, someone shorted XRT with 100,000 shares on a downtick, thus working around the SSR and trying to destroy upward momentum again: <https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT>. Spoiler: It didn't work.

Guess which price would start the call chain? Correct: $50. So, Citadel and Friends and Institutions are battling around the $50 mark right now. Citadel and Friends don't want a gamma squeeze to take place again, so they keep shorting to keep it under $50. And someone with shitloads of money keeps buying and trying to drive the price above $50 before close, so the call chain starts rolling.

What supports me in my theory is: After the price dropped <$50, there was a battle around the $50 for quite some time, after that, the price has been going sideways for hours. Both sides are probably waiting for the other side to do something, in order to counter that with either more shorts, or a sudden jump in buy-volume. That's why no one is doing anything right now, because only the closing price and that we stay around $50 till then in order to close above $50 counts.

EDIT: ANOTHER HINT TO FURTHER SUPPORT MY THEORY: The $50 mark battle had insane volume. After HF shorted GME twice and UI battled around that price, the volume died down to 10 - 20 % of what it was around that mark (<https://imgur.com/a/s5lY3Hr>). For me it looks like they just tested each other to see how far the other party will go in order to reach their goal and are now waiting for what I wrote above.

TL;DR: Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲

PSA: GME IS RESTRICTED FROM SHORTING ONLY ON DOWNTICKS! THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SHORT ON UPTICKS. (Short Sale Restriction List: [ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210223.xls](https://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210223.xls)) Thanks to [u/ HYPERLINK "https://www.reddit.com/u/designerinsider/"designerinsider](https://www.reddit.com/u/designerinsider/) for providing the list!

EDIT: IT DOES NOT MATTER FOR US IF WE CLOSE ABOVE OR BELOW $50! Just wanted to clarify. If we close above $50, that would be a huge win and an almost certain catalyst for a Gamma Squeeze, if they exercise their options. But what if we close below $50? Nothing changes. Diamonds Hands are really important atm and it's only a matter of time until that bubble pops.

EDIT2: FURTHER HINT SUPPORTING MY THEORY: THEY JUST BORROWED 1,000,000 (YES, 1 MILLION!) ADDITIONAL SHARES TO SHORT. THEY ARE PREPARING!

EDIT4: Seems like Institutions are baiting out the Hedgies right now, we broke $50 again! BUT BE CAREFUL! Hedgies borrowed 1,000,000 Shares in order to short the stock again and again. Our allies are propably trying to bait out those borrowed shares at the moment and the price will dip a few times and have huge volatility. If we don't have any huge dips today, that means the Hedgies didn't short their borrowed shares yet. Keep that in mind for the following days! They might accept their fate today and let it close above $50, but try to interrupt the upward momentum when those Calls become ITM and get exercised.

---------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: An Institution (probably another hedge fund) set up an options chain ranging from $50 into the high hundreds. Well knowing that it will work, because Gamestop was only allowed to be shorted on upticks, because it was on the SSR that day! Why was it on the SSR? The same someone made sure it got there the day before. Because people were not selling GME and the volume was really low until then, they prepared to buy in shortly before the market closed, because it was easier to reach their price target with less capital when the volume is as low as it was that day. Citadel and Friends didn't even try to fight back that evening. They probably knew who was behind it and knew what kind of money they are fighting against (Remember that battle mid-day at the $50 mark). They tested each other at that moment.

THE RABBIT HOLE PART III:

Okay, now we know that someone planned all this over the span of a week and the plan was executed perfectly working in, whoever planned its, favor. But why is someone planning all this and spending that much money on a gamma squeeze and then just forgets about it and doesn't care what the price is the days after? Because now we get to the real shit that sounds like something out of a conspiracy or movie. Spoiler: Whoever set up the Gamma Squeeze set it up as a bait for Citadel and never cared about it actually happening or not. They just wanted it to make it look like they want a Gamma Squeeze to happen. Here is why:

On the 26th of February I posted an important post regarding the illegal naked shorting with counterfeit shares. Here is a link to the post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsvl8k/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/>

On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). Those were naked shorts being done with counterfeit shares. Brief explanation: Naked Short --- This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation -- the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share --- instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.

So, naked shorting is not always illegal. It is legal IF the market makers are able to deliver the shorted shares within a given time period. And now it gets really juicy.

Fails--to--Deliver --- The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a "buy--in," and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.

So, what we now know is, there was huge short volume on the 25th February, the biggest in the history of GME (let's take the middle of the lowest and the highest report and we have a short volume of 42,000,000). Why? In order to stop the Gamma Rocket from lifting off and delaying the real short squeeze. Citadel and Friends naked shorted GME with about 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 shares that don't exist, additional to the already existing short positions they have.

IN SHORT: Whoever planned all that knew, that Citadel and Friends were going to MASSIVELY overshort GME and it was prepared and planned to happen on that exact day. Whoever planned it, trapped Citadel and Friends into a corner of poor despair and desperation. But why on THAT EXACT DATE you may ask yourself now?

THE RABBIT HOLE PART IV:

Let's get to the final and REALLY REALLY REALLY juicy stuff. Why was all this important? Why the bait setup? Why at that exact date? And to which date is everything pointing to?

What else do we need to know before we get to the juicy stuff? There are about 63 ETFs containing GME, that are massively shorted as well as the underlying GME stock itself. We only need to know about the one ETF that has almost 10 % of their Portfolio being GME for this. The biggest one there is: XRT. Why is XRT so interesting?

As of 25th of February XRT GME holdings increased from 3% yesterday to 10% today. (<https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/>)

As of 26th of February, XRT is also the MOST HEAVILY SHORTED ETF IN THE WORLD with almost 200 % of their shares being sold short. (<https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/>)

What does this tell us? XRT is the prime ETF used by Citadel and Friends to hide their real short positions from the public.

So, when is it going to happen? AT AROUND(!)FRIDAY, MARCH 19th 2021. Evidence to support that date and everything coming together:

First, we have to take a look at the basis of the current situation.

AS OF THE 23RD OF FEBRUARY, THE SHORT INTEREST WAS CALCULATED TO BE AT LEAST 430 %. THAT NUMBER BECOMES MUCH MUCH HIGHER IF WE TAKE THE SHORT ACTIVITY FROM 25TH AND 24TH INTO ACCOUNT!

23rdFeb Calculation:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

Evidence to support March 19th 2021:

1\. AI Prediction starts around that Date:

[![r/GME - Endgame DD: How last weeks actions all come together to one specific Date. All the data analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/g5wh5zxsb6l61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=596a22807faccea6f6fa96b6d1d1f96f385eefdb)](https://preview.redd.it/g5wh5zxsb6l61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=596a22807faccea6f6fa96b6d1d1f96f385eefdb)

2. Remember the naked short activity on 24th and 25thFeb? Now It is really important to look at the date, when the biggest naked short activity happened and why it was so important to look at what naked shorting is and what the result of naked shorting is. Remember! Market makers have a special exemption that gives them 21 days to purchase actual shares after naked shorting. That's 33 -- 51 million more purchases by? You guessed it. Friday March 19th from 25th February's naked shorting alone and 12 million from 24th to be purchased one day prior.

3\. March 19th is XRT rebalance day. XRT releases dividends every 3 months. Last one was December 21st,2020. Estimated next payout is around March 20th. By this time the shorts NEED to cover their GME shorts through XRT. (<https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/xrt/dividend-history>) (Answered that in my Interview that I linked above, there is much more behind this and I explained it there!)

4. Massive option chains set up for 3/19 with volume so big, that only large Institutions who know what's coming set it up.

As of the 26thFEB, XRT has 18,000 volume on 80$ Puts for 3/19. For comparison: The volume for 3/26 80$ puts is 142.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRT/options?date=1616112000&p=XRT>

XRT Puts for 3/19:

- 5,558 @ $45

- 14,394 @ $50

- 7,633 @ $55

- 29,787 @ $60

- 14,138 @ $65

- 32,919 @ $70

- 8,063 @ $75

- 17,853 @ $80

Further comparisons:

XRT Puts for 2/26: 2314 Puts at any strike on the chain combined.

XRT Puts for 3/5: 2139 Puts at any strike on the chain combined.

GameStop has more than ten thousand of 800$ calls for? 3/19.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&date=1616112000>

VIX (SPY Volatility Index) has insane volume on calls two days prior (tens of thousands, even 100k) (Brief explanation to what the VIX is: VIX is the ticker symbol and the popular name for the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index, a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options.)

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/options?date=1615939200 HYPERLINK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/options?date=1615939200&p=%5EVIX)

On 3/19/21 Put interest EXPLODES in contract numbers and volume! Only one week later, it goes back down to almost zero.

Facebook is the same.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/options?p=FB&date=1616112000>

Coca Cola is the same.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/options?p=KO&date=1616112000>

Starbucks is the same.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX/options?p=SBUX&date=1616112000>

Johnson and Johnson is the same.

<https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ/options?p=JNJ&date=1616112000>

Market makers are hedging what they own with puts to save the value of their shares they currently own in case the market implodes. I'm marking my calendar... 3/19/21 is lining up perfectly to be the day the shit truly hits the fan for the market.

5. Quadruple Witching Day.

What Is Quadruple Witching? (<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp>)

Quadruple witching refers to a date on which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously.

While stock options contracts and index options expire on the third Friday of every month, all four asset classes expire simultaneously on the third Friday of March (Which day was it again were talking about? Oh, right, Friday March 19th, the third Friday of the month), June, September, and December**. Quadruple witching days witness heavy trading volume, in part, due to the offsetting of existing futures and options contracts that are profitable.**

Quadruple witching is similar to the triple witching dates, when three out of the four markets expire at the same time, or double witching, when two markets out of the four markets expire at the same time. *You should expect all kinds of fuckery on a quad witching date. GME mooning and crashing the rest of the market would certainly be appropriate for a quad witching date*. (Quoting u/ [Scfi4444](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scfi4444/))

6. Gamestop Q4 Earnings are released ~~4~~ (EDIT 03/14. Apparently the date moved up to 03/23, so it's 2 Business Days) Business Days after March 19th, that'll be another catalyst to keep the flame going for a few days. Because Q4 is the the quarter, where retail makes their most revenue. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings#:~:text=Earnings%20announcement*%20for%20GME%3A%20Mar%2025%2C%202021 HYPERLINK "https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings"& HYPERLINK "https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings"text=According%20to%20Zacks%20Investment%20Research,quarter%20last%20year%20was%20%241.27](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings).

7. Market makers were so sure of GameStop's bankruptcy, that they wrote lots of naked call options. A call option is a contract with the OPTION to buy a stock at a certain price in the future. Call options cost money (a premium) and they're pretty cheap. The contract specifies a strike price (at what stock price can you execute the contract) and is always higher than the current stock price.

Because of the massive violence inflicted on GME stock with the shorting, the sellers of the contracts were also sure that contracts with strike prices higher than let's say $20 COULD never be executed. They became greedy and reckless and decided to sell more contracts than they actually owned stock. In fact, they sold MILLIONS OF SHARES WORTH of contracts for which they don't and didn't own stock.

This means that the buyer of the contract is able to request the stock for that contract from the seller. If you never had the stock to begin with, THATS A PROBLEM. If you sold this contract naked, now you have to go in the market to buy it AT ANY PRICE or risk massive fines and sanctions.

And at what day does the shit hit the fan again? Oh, right, a Friday. But not any day. It's Friday, March 19th 2021.

MY Conclusion: The squeeze is inevitable. It got delayed many times, but no matter what data you look at, the outcome is always the same, everything points to this specific date. Also: Other Hedge funds smell blood. They can take out some of their biggest competitors as well as making billions and billions of dollars in the process. There couldn't be a bigger win win situation for them, than this one. I think the squeeze is starting a few days, maybe even a week prior to March 19th. I think that it'll start March 15th and build up all the way to March 19th, where the real rocket takes off. How long is it going to last? I don't know, no one does. But I think it's going to last for at least one week. Of course, it's going to get more and more expensive to buy in over time, so you don't want to miss out. As always: Buy and Hodl.

pixel out.
