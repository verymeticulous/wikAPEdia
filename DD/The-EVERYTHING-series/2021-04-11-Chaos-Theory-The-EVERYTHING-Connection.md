[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

EDIT 1: THE MODS DID NOT TAKE DOWN THE POST. THIS WAS A RESULT OF ME ATTEMPTING TO INCLUDE THE STORY BELOW IN EDIT 4 FROM A BLACKLISTED SITE ARTICLE WHICH CAUSED THE AUTOMOD TO DELETE THE POST. I hoped that the removal of the link fixed the text but it didn't, this is a Reddit issue, not a mod one. LAY OFF THE MOD NARRATIVE

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for the feedback so far; I posted this here as a means to incite further conversation and thoughts. I'm modifying this post as I go, understanding that certain elements are simply TOO speculative.

EDIT 3: There seems to be concern in how I've represented Swiss Re as a reinsurer. I'd just like to confirm that they self-identify as such on most of their portals. You can verify this via a quick Google Search. They also [DO handle re/insurance asset management](https://www.swissre.com/our-business/managing-our-assets) contrary to what has been mentioned.

EDIT 4: [BlackRock appears to be eyeing Credit Suisse fund management arm](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-asset-management-m-a-ex-idUSKBN2BW2CT). I'll let you speculate what this may mean in relation to their existing relationship with Swiss Re

EDIT 5: It is not my intention to make this community appear as a team of conspiracy theorists. There are some deep implications with the evidence that I've showcased that potentially show deeper interlinking between hundreds of the biggest companies. I couldn't possibly attempt to explain each and every single web, so I leave it to you to continue digging!

EDIT 6: Look I get it, some of you feel that the fact we have tax havens around the world AREN'T a big deal. What is interesting however is that all these players are registered to the same place, and it appears that the government wants to do something about it

EDIT 7 (April 12th, 2021): We now have the inclusion of Mr. Gary Gensler to the mix who will be heading the SEC starting the 19th of April (talk about timing huh). He specializes in cryptocurrencies and darkpools - but more importantly he was the only that finally called on the banks during the 2008 recession: <https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/senate-set-to-approve-gary-gensler-nomination-for-sec-chairman-but-likely-for-brief-term/>

EDIT 8: In-case you're curious, the former SEC chairman, Jay Clayton (brought in during the Trump administration) just took a job at Apollo Global Management (which [Tiger Global Management] holds a 14.8% stake in, making them the largest shareholder of Apollo other than a private holdings company from Apollo themselves (BRH) (<https://fintel.io/so/us/apo>));

Lets not forget about Mr. Heath Tarbert, who was the former chairmen of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) who just got hired by Kenny boy as one of his Chief Legal Officers at Citadel not even 2 weeks ago. Heath had this to say about his friend Jay Clayton.

> "It has been an honor to serve alongside Jay Clayton. He is one of the smartest and most capable transactional attorneys in the country and an even better colleague and friend. As leaders of the SEC and CFTC, we have worked together closely to harmonize our rules where appropriate and hold wrongdoers accountable.

Directly from the cftc site: <https://cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8310-20> . Still not a conflict of interest?

Now back to the post,

Citadel, BlackRock, Susquehanna, and many others are intricately connected through a variety of sources; namely offshore tax havens as proven through the Panama & Paradise Papers. I attempt to piece together what I believe is the reason we are seeing certain behavior from each of these parties.

What you're about to read is MY ATTEMPT to amalgamate multiple pieces of DD by various users from across multiple subs, discord and private discussions in an attempt to piece together what may be happening behind the scenes in the darkside of the financial world. THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT'S 100% RIGHT, SIMPLY MY THOUGHTS ON HOW ALL THESE ELEMENTS MAY PIECE TOGETHER.

I INTEND FOR THIS TO BE THE START OF A FRAMEWORK THAT GETS DEVELOPED OVER TIME. I HOPE TO PROVIDE A STARTING POINT.

Now grab yourself a beer and strap in, this is about to get crazy. 👨‍🚀👩‍🚀

SECTION 1. INTRODUCTION

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

As a prerequisite I highly recommend reading through [/u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt) 's "[The EVERYTHING Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)" whitepaper. It provides a lot of context as to what's going on under the hood and gets you primed for this post. I'd also highly recommend reading through [/u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid) 's DD "[The Missing 🧩](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mlf82b/the_missing_citadels_frenemies_pfof_michael/gtneg3m/?context=3)"; for an understanding of how much deeper this potentially goes. Lastly thank you to [/u/tropicalsecret](https://www.reddit.com/user/tropicalsecret) for helping me hash out some missing pieces and their [investigative work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnlvhf/here_is_all_the_arms_of_susquehanna/) as well.

My name is [/u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/user/sharkbaitlol) and over the last couple of weeks or so I've prioritized investigating this story further while putting my consultancy on hold - I feel that this is the start of something bigger than any of us can imagine that can improve ours, and our children's lives. I've prided myself in my career as a data scientist and a lifelong gamer in being able to pick up on patterns. I hope that I'm able to help support our community further with this DD. Special thank you to all those who have contributed their time and expertise to getting us this far. I will be referencing other DD written and hope you understand that even if not mentioned, almost every single DD post written by apes has helped getting us closer to the truth.

With that being said, lets jump in.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SECTION 2. FOLLOW THE MONEY

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

As we know Susquehanna has been of interest in recent weeks due to their suspicious nature of their position within the GME saga. This suspicion grew quickly when some Redditors pointed out that Dr. Burry may have been pointing a finger at Susquehanna through a hidden message on [Twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mlf82b/the_missing_citadels_frenemies_pfof_michael/) (whether this is really what was happening is up to you) - now we have Sus attempting to [appeal new DTCC regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mmh5jb/susquehanna_is_sus_part_2_elia_the_occ801_rule/) SR-OCC-2021-003 to make things even weirder. Their growing position prompted me me to start doing a deep dive on their positions across the market; particularly how they've [DOUBLED](https://i.imgur.com/KEE1ZQl.png) in size since the start of the pandemic, parties of association, and conflict of interest across the stock market. What I was able to find has left me baffled at how interconnected all this actually is. Remember this throughout this post, THERE ARE NO COINCINDICES.

We begin by looking at Susquehanna's filings to the SEC. We're able to figure out that they break down into multiple connections with the following:

-   Susquehanna Investment Group

-   Susquehanna Securities, LLC

-   Capital Ventures International

-   Susquehanna Advisors Group, Inc

-   CVI Opportunities Fund I, LLLP

-   G1 Execution Services, LLC

-   Darby Financial Products

Now I've highlighted Capital Ventures International (CVI) as this will be our main point of interest of now for the peculiar reason that they're based out of Cayman Islands. You know, that little island of 64k people where Citadel is laundering bonds? Yeah it turns out they're not the only ones, not by a long shot.

"The ultimate beneficial owners of Susquehanna and CVI are substantially the same". Source: Finra

You can find the source for the address on BrokerCheck Report [here](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_35865.pdf) under Finra's website. What they're saying basically saying is that description at the end there, is that Susquehanna Financial and CVI are beneficially owned by the same company (fancy speak for have 25% or more total control of the company); CVI hold around [$839 million.](https://fintel.io/i/cvi-investments)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SECTION 3. LET'S TAKE A TRIP TO THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND BACK AGAIN

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Great now that we understand that CVI is in bed with Susquehanna and owned by them; lets go a layer deeper. It's mentioned that this address is located at Winward 1, Regatta Office Park, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. I was genuinely curious if this address was even real; after a quick Google search, none other than the PARADISE PAPERS come up. Remember the massive investigation that exposed some of the most powerful leaders to tax havens around the world?

[Offshoreleaks](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/) is a pretty amazing website that allows you to do a network visualization to see who's connected with what. So we start digging; *keep in mind that the data from these papers are from 2014 so some names/elements have been slightly modified since then.*

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/je2dzgbn8hs61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9bc1b50175baaad96fb658ad807da37fd0a8f4b)](https://preview.redd.it/je2dzgbn8hs61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9bc1b50175baaad96fb658ad807da37fd0a8f4b)

We connected directly to someone named William Walmsley. Source: Offshoreleaks

You'll notice that Mr. Walmsley comes up a few times throughout this post, but for now we see that he's connected to this address that CVI is registered to. We can confirm his participation in CVI via a 13G FILING through the SEC.

He's the director of CVI as seen [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649553/000110465919006973/a19-4181_31sc13g.htm).

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/yrsl1u9qchs61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb91baef9bc9b5f159958496da49246d3c4bb2c)](https://preview.redd.it/yrsl1u9qchs61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb91baef9bc9b5f159958496da49246d3c4bb2c)

*EDIT: FURTHER VALIDATION OF APOLLO INVESTMENTS LIMITED REQUIRED. THIS APPEARS TO BE A REGISTERED ENTITY IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AS A SHELL NAME. I CANNOT CONFIRM IF THIS IS ACTUALLY THE APOLLO INVESTMENTS MENTIONED BELOW YET. THERE'S MANY NAMES THAT COME CLOSE TO THIS SHELL COMPANY YOU SEE HERE. WE GET APOLLO VALUE INVESTMENT Offshore Fund LTD, WHICH IS AS YOU GUESSED - ANOTHER OFFSHORE SHELL COMPANY IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. YOU EITHER CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A COMPANY CALLED APOLLO INVEMENTS LIMITED BY CHANCE, OR THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH APOLLO INVESTMENTS. EVEN WITHOUT THIS PIECE WE STILL SEE APOLLO'S HAND IN THE UGLAND HOUSE:* [*https://whalewisdom.com/filer/apollo-total-return-co-investors-a-lp*](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/apollo-total-return-co-investors-a-lp)

We see a second address come up in the above screenshot for a place called the "Ugland House" located in the Cayman Islands in this filing associated with CVI. Hold that thought for now, we'll go over it soon.

Going back our network visualization screen shot with Mr. Walmsley, he leads us to yet another connection called "Apollo Investments" (you'll notice that CVI isn't on that screenshot, this is because the first filings we see for CVI is at the end of year 2017 whereas the Paradise Papers were published prior to that). "Apollo Investments" will be the next piece of the puzzle.

So who are they? Well we know they manage about $13bn and invest mostly in finance, industrials, and information technology (top buys being SPY puts (oof, there goes a chunk of change)) *[just want to clarify here that Apollo Investments is directly affiliated with Apollo Management, you get redirected on their site to the main Apollo Page].*

So to recap we know that Mr. Walmsley is located in the Cayman Islands, Director of CVI which is owned by Susquehanna, AND some sort of senior title in a a company called Apollo Investment.

EDIT: For a whole another rabbit hole check out Jay Clayton who was chairman of the SEC (as instated during the TRUMP administration) who now works for Apollo: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Clayton_(attorney)> with the following description: " In February 2021, [Apollo Global Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management) appointed Clayton to the newly created role of lead independent director on its board "

Lets not forget about Mr. Heath Tarbert, who was the former chairmen of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) who just got hired by Kenny boy as one of his Chief Legal Officers at Citadel not even 2 weeks ago. Heath had this to say about his friend Jay Clayton.

> "It has been an honor to serve alongside Jay Clayton. He is one of the smartest and most capable transactional attorneys in the country and an even better colleague and friend. As leaders of the SEC and CFTC, we have worked together closely to harmonize our rules where appropriate and hold wrongdoers accountable.

Directly from the cftc site: <https://cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8310-20> . Still not a conflict of interest?

EDIT 2: Maybe I'm just cherry picking information here, but we see that Citadel had hired Apollo's head of corporate credit trade in the last 2 years; check out this excerpt "

> Since joining Citadel in 2019, Salame, one of Wall Street's most prominent trading executives, has expanded the credit team amid a hiring spree at the firm. He last week hired Prakash Narayanan from CQS, who was one of Michael Hintze's top performers. David Casner joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year as head of convertible bonds and equity volatility."

Interesting.. Head of convertible bonds and equity volatility...

<https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/citadel-hires-apollos-head-corporate-credit-trading>

Now have a look at who are the [majority stakeholders](https://fintel.io/so/us/apo%201%20c38) are of Apollo Global Management:

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/opu7bsip8hs61.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e5d78bf2272a6886e22248131749b7e4cd2fc1)](https://preview.redd.it/opu7bsip8hs61.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e5d78bf2272a6886e22248131749b7e4cd2fc1)

Hmmm, some familiar faces. Source: Fintel

Wait... TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT? Hasn't one of the Tiger Cubs associated with them -- you know, just gotten blown up? More on [The Archegos phiasco](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rattled-archegos-stocks-investable-again-201150296.html) and how they screwed Credit Suisse. How VANGUARD is associated here, I'm not exactly sure yet...

Remember how I said there's no coincidences? Lets have a look where both APOLLO and TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT are located in New York.

INTRODUCING THE SOLOW BUILDING

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/n0bywa0r8hs61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=f32f2f8de1c3b0a12330dd3aab0efa5869b05e3a)](https://preview.redd.it/n0bywa0r8hs61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=f32f2f8de1c3b0a12330dd3aab0efa5869b05e3a)

I can't remember where I saw it, but I believe Mr. Walmsley had something to do with Highland Capital too. I have hundreds of tabs open guys you'll have to give me a pass on this one. Source: Wikipedia

We'll totally ignore the other tenants for now; although I'm sure they have their hand in the cookie jar haha (cough* Chanel, cough* Bombardier). But lo and behold, one of the largest holders of Apollo are the Tigers which happen to be in the same building. [What a story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddu4Gj3hmgc) huh.

SIDE QUEST TIME

Marc Rowan of Apollo became the new CEO just back in February of this year after the old CEO Leon Black stepped down due to links to "the late financier and convicted sex offender J3FFR3Y 3PST3IN". [WHAT LOL](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apollo-global-ceo-idUSKBN2AO2XF).

Rowan was also quoted saying the following during a Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum:

> "The opportunity, nothing other than that, and in the middle of a pandemic taking a sabbatical is never a good idea," Rowan said during the Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum when asked why he wanted the role.

SIDE QUEST PART 2

Tiger Global Management's Executive Scott Shleifer in the last month purchased a lovely $132 million dollar Palm Beach house on a piece of land owned by the former President. He also owns 14.8% of Apollo Global Managment:[SEC 13G/A Filing](https://sec.report/Document/0000919574-21-001610/)

HOLD YOUR BREATHE, WE'RE GOING DEEPER

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SECTION 4. THE UGLAND HOUSE

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Let's go back to that other address we saw registered with CVI Investments; we see another business address labelled under a place called the "Ugland House, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands". I did some more research around this place and SURPRISE, right back to the Paradise Papers we go.

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/bn2g8g0y8hs61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=976494dea948c3d3e40f4d253ba889222718f48e)](https://preview.redd.it/bn2g8g0y8hs61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=976494dea948c3d3e40f4d253ba889222718f48e)

This place is so COOL that it has it's own Wikipedia page! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugland_House>

I love this quote from Wikipedia on it:

> " During his first presidential campaign, U.S. President [Barack 0bama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) referred to Ugland House as "the biggest tax scam in the world", raising questions over the number of companies with a registered office in the building."

Here's a picture of this monster sized building that houses 40,000 entities and businesses

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/juhw8s219hs61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f8b0ccc24cd7ea9a3c2210c88e74d1c6a0d91d7)](https://preview.redd.it/juhw8s219hs61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f8b0ccc24cd7ea9a3c2210c88e74d1c6a0d91d7)

Where do you think they fit all of them?

So lets see what's connected to this address

That EXACT address (the exact way it was written out on the CVI document), is linked to a company called MOUSSESCALE which is owned by Mousse Partners. REMEMBER, there's thousands of businesses registered here, but they seem to have some variants or "locations" within the Ugland House. However guess where the Mousse Partners NY office is... 9 West 57th street which is...

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/nj3z25g59hs61.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ebad8992d1e1cbe56a0b6ddcb9433850b63324)](https://preview.redd.it/nj3z25g59hs61.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ebad8992d1e1cbe56a0b6ddcb9433850b63324)

REMEMBER NO COINCIDENCES

BTW look what's just around the corner of the Solow building

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/o709v7na9hs61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=de1d7224f0d4276daf5d01c43a3d261b4e085677)](https://preview.redd.it/o709v7na9hs61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=de1d7224f0d4276daf5d01c43a3d261b4e085677)

maybe just a coincidence, New York is a small place

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ANOTHER SIDE QUEST

Did I also mention that the Chief Investment Officer of Mousse Partner Limited, Suzi Kwon Cohen (can't make this up), was the principal at Credit Suisse in Private Equity? Just 2 floors below Apollo?

There's also only 44 people that work at Mousse Partners... Man what are the *chances*.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

FUN FACT

Susquehanna has associations with other "[organization affiliates](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_35865.pdf) (see "SAL Trading, LLC"; "DARBY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS"; "SIG STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, LLLP") at 1201 N Orange St, Wilmington, DE, USA. You can read all about those shenanigans here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation_Trust_Center_(CT_Corporation)>

Spoiler, it's another tax loophole right in Delaware's backyard with 285,000 separate businesses registered to it.

EDIT: Some people seem to think this is a null point; it is your opinion on whether you think this is right or wrong even if it's a legal loophole. This location has been linked to 9.5 billion dollars of taxes have been evaded as a result of this location (as of 2012).

Here's the behemoth of a building that houses 285k businesses.

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/f3c09jwd9hs61.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78d8ce5409e0fc6c2ef5c39f1f8c526c5acd6edd)](https://preview.redd.it/f3c09jwd9hs61.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78d8ce5409e0fc6c2ef5c39f1f8c526c5acd6edd)

I hope they have enough parking space for everyone

I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS, BUT WE'RE GOING EVEN DEEPER

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SECTION 5. A NEW FOE HAS APPEARED ----- TREAD LIGHTLY, SOME ELEMENTS HERE LIKE THE BLACKROCK -> CITADEL COMPONENTS ARE SPECULATIVE

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now how is Citadel involved with all this you may wonder? Well as it turns out, they have an entity tied to the Ugland house as well; that's right the same exact building that Apollo and CVI (Susquehanna) are connected to. [[Citadel Kensington Global is a direct subsidiary of Citadel]](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-kensington-global-strategies-fund-ltd) who are due for another D/A filing sometime in May. They manage a cool 17bn.

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/7yerskyg9hs61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=449638a65214090de733db68847ab33857716ab7)](https://preview.redd.it/7yerskyg9hs61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=449638a65214090de733db68847ab33857716ab7)

Turns out Citadel is doing some business overseas

Now we start to getting into [/u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt) 's territory of the "EVERYTHING Short" research. They're (Citadel) operating out of multiple places in the Cayman Islands and the Ugland House is the prime destination. They're flipping bonds here and making bank.

Now GUESS who we build a direct connection to?

[![r/Superstonk - Chaos Theory - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://preview.redd.it/qofbn2hh9hs61.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdc0cee399c1623e461f81b4924ff514d424bf53)](https://preview.redd.it/qofbn2hh9hs61.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdc0cee399c1623e461f81b4924ff514d424bf53)

Wait a minute, what's BlackRock doing here?

As it turns out BlackRock is the owner of a company called Swiss Re. Now who's Swiss Re?

Directly from their [Wikipedia Page:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Re)

*The Swiss Reinsurance Company of Zurich was founded on 19 December 1863 by the Helvetia General Insurance Company (now known as* [*Helvetia Versicherungen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetia)*) in* [*St. Gallen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Gallen)*,* *the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (*[*Credit Suisse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse)*) in* [*Zurich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich) *and the Basler Handelsbank (predecessor of* [*UBS AG*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS_AG)*) in* [*Basel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel)*.*

That's right, Swiss Re was formed by none other than CREDIT SUISSE

Some more on them:

They're basically something called a *reinsurer.* In-case you're not familiar:

*A* *reinsurer* *is an insurance company that insures the risks of other insurance companies. A cedant is an insurer who transfers all or part of a risk to a* *reinsurer**. The* *reinsurer* *covers all the insurance policies coming within the scope of the reinsurance contract.*

They're the insurance, FOR the insurance. Why is this important? Look who owns them as of 2012 [[BlackRock]](https://ir.blackrock.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-releases-details/2012/BlackRock-to-Acquire-Swiss-Re-Private-Equity-Partners-AG-Announces-Strategic-Alternative-Investment-Partnership-with-Swiss-Re-Enhances-Private-Equity-Fund-of-Funds-Capabilities-Deepens-Presence-in-Switzerland/default.aspx). I should also mention at this point that Swiss Re manages a cool $240bn in assets as of 2019 - nothing to be scoffed at. Add to the fact that 39% of their investments are in government bonds, and 27% in credit bonds; *directly from their* [investor presentation](https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:205daff9-56f9-445f-a2cd-9d3aba31253e/fy-2020-slides-presentation-doc.pdf)*:*

SECTION 6. FAMILIAR FACES -------- PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS COMPONENT IS PURELY MY SPECULATION ON THE MATTER YET AGAIN; WE CANNOT DEFINITELY SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN BLACKROCK + SWISS RE AND CITADEL + PALAFOX EXISTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE DATA FROM THE PARADISE PAPERS AREN'T RECENT ENOUGH

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now that we understand who Swiss Re is; INTROOOOOOODUCING OUR BACK-TO-BACK ALL-STAR, PALAFOX TRADING LLC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Already made infamous in the "EVERYTHING Short" post once again, Palafox has been acting as a direct proxy for Citadel as a means to rehypothecate bonds to quickly cash out and add liquidity to the market.

Now how do THEY connect? First we see that the public accountant is a company called Pricewaterhousecoopers which work with Palafox. EDIT HERE: Thank you to the community for helping clear this point up. We know that this may be a null conclusion considering PWC works across a multitude of clients across the world. For now all that we can say for certain in this section is that Citadel & BlackRock have registered entities to the Ugland House. Do with that information what you will. THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER. REMEMBER 40K BUSINESSES ARE REGISTERED HERE!

Now lets zoom out on the network visualization from earlier that connect BlackRock with Citadel through the Ugland House.

EDIT: REMOVED SECTION ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION AS IT WAS TOO SPECULATIVE. JUST KNOW FOR NOW THAT BOTH MEMBERS HAVE ENTITIES ARE REGISTERED TO THE SAME TWO LOCATIONS IN CAYMAN ISLANDS AND BAHAMAS

SECTION 7. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR APES

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I believe the connection between Susquehanna > CVI > Apollo > Tiger Global Management> Credit Suisse > Swiss Re > Citadel > BlackRock is incredibly complex and has many moving pieces beyond what any of us imagined. I believe that there is a 5D game of chess being played, and apes are just a pawn that is plowing the way to victory. IT IS IN MY OPINION that BlackRock isn't just looking to kill off Mevlin. I think they may be working with the government + fed(which has been shown they've done on occasion) to make some major changes happen to the market. What's the end goal? It's not entirely obvious to me yet. You can read a bit more about it on Bloomberg under the title "Why BlackRock is now the 'fourth branch of government' ". Sorry I'd post the link but I don't want automoderator to kick in again (just google that title).

As I was compiling this information look for no further than the POTUS himself for confirmation bias just from 3 days ago: SKIP TO 38:20 OR SO <https://twitter.com/potus/status/1379857925875888128?s=21>

> *I've also proposed a global minimum tax... Let me tell you what the means, that means companies won't be able to hide their incomes in places like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda*

EDIT (April 12th, 2021): We now have the inclusion of Mr. Gary Gensler to the mix who will be heading the SEC starting the 19th of April (talk about timing huh). He specializes in cryptocurrencies and darkpools - but more importantly he was the only that finally called on the banks during the 2008 recession: <https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/senate-set-to-approve-gary-gensler-nomination-for-sec-chairman-but-likely-for-brief-term/>

TLDR; I think there's a lot of shady things going on in the world. Whether you believe all of it, or none of it; JUST HODL. I hope this framework can help you start your own research in figuring out what we're dealing with here!

We are approaching something huge apes. Diamond Fucking Hands 💎✋🦍
