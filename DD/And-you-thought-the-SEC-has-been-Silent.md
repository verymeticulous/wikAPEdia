They have quietly restricted access to information they are required to make public (you are still right about the silent part)

What:

Form ADV? Among other things, contains the most up to date information on any registered investor of firm and can be 100+ pages long. One can normally obtain the form here (scroll to bottom search bar): <https://www.investor.gov/CRS>

When:

However, as of this morning (mar 27, 2021) it's been disabled. I have been using this site wo issue for a l o n g time so to see this gov.'t web search *suddenly stop working* raises no red flags. I did post about the good intel that you can find on this form about hedge funds for the first time 6days ago and it was working fine then too

Good times people /s

I did save the link for Melvin's Form ADV here:

<https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf>

Anyone happen to have the link to Citadel's form adv for a trade? (Edit: you guys have since found a few for me to look thru, thank you!)

TL; DR: the US Securities and Exchanges (SEC) has restricted our access to information *they are required to make public*

Edit:\
[Realizing that Citadel does control manipulating algorithms to their advantage ($22M is the equivalent of a parking ticket compared to paying out actual costs. costs he later pockets)](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2017-11.html)

Edit-2: Holy wow thank you for all these awards, im feeling special

Edit-3: Information from all you wonderful people that exposes the gaps, for others to fill in is how we keep them from hiding as well as weakens their narrative. Short version is that I cant access the full information i need (thanks SEC) but here are some facts, possibly related. I do not know if they are related, need someone w brains to shek it out:

- [GoldmanSachs sold an enormous amount of shares on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unprecedented-wall-street-ponders-goldman-232214658.html)

- Who are Custodians to at least one or more financial accounts in Melvin (as of Mar 8) and Citadel (as of Jan)? GoldmanSachs (source: [Melvin---scroll to p12](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf), [Citadel---scroll to p.79)](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/148826/PDF/148826.pdf)

- I dont understand how the same entity...to put it simply....can act as a competitive player on both sides. And its not just GSachs, there are other banks listed 🧠🍳

- PriceWaterCoopers are Citadel's main auditors. Oh to be a fly on the wall when they get periodic mandatory sit-downs

CONTINUE TO EXPOSE QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR AND ACTIONS (note to self: and dwnld the pdfs nxt time i get access)

Update: Sunday, March 28th

- website search access back on as of this afternoon

- [this citadel securities document profiles the 58 sanctions the firm has received over the years](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf) What to look at? Search for allegations and only read through those, even the older ones because they can tell an interesting story. (Forewarned, all in caps oof) A suggestion I have to maybe not get distracted by the (low) fine amounts or how they 'settle' with the SEC and other entities without admitting guilt and thirdly, if you are not well versed in the terminology, if you understand every third word, i think you will come away with an adequate general understanding of how they roll. (Or at least in these instances in which they were caught

- it's late, I haven't downloaded all of Citadel's to start to imagine let alone start an empirically grounded visual+text mapping of who, what processes exist, problematic structures. Its my belief that something like this, developed by all of us, until all gaps are filled, can help strengthen communications with our representatives. However, also I think it will help identify what needs to be addressed and prioritized first i say this recognizing there's a black hole of important information we can't get access to but, I think we could start first, then cross that bridge when we get to it. I dont have a timeline planned (am in school rn too) so I would say Im in the Brainstorming stage.

Thoughts, ideas, outlines, suggestions welcome, by everyone as to utility of developing something as ive described to better communicate with state/national representative who are to advocate for equitable and fair trading for every_one_

And because the alternative is dim: crowdfund and donate gross amount of money to select representatives of our collective choosing. Hire ex gov't officials and lawyers in economic policy to be consultants. not really funny bc they have already been hired by? 🛎 Citadel
