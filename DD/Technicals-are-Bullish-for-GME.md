TLDR; Volume, MACD, and Short Availability are all extremely bullish for GME. HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Hang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.

Case 1 : VOLUME

Look at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

Secondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.

Wow, look at this set-up

Case 2 : MACD

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.

MACD looks bullish

Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT

From last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

600,000 shares shorted!

Final Thoughts

There are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or "In The Money". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.

This also doesn't consider the fundamental change in the company and how to properly revalue GameStop from a traditional brick and mortar to an e-commerce player.

The technicals signify bullishness and you should continue HODL. Don't be scared with dips as long as the trend is your friend. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
