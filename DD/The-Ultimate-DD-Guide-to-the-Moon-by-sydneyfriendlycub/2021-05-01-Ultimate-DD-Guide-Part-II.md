PART 2

We are getting there!!! By the end of this posts, Kenny will be FULLY EXPOSED!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW AND WHY TO BANKRUPT COMPANIES

While a company is heading to bankruptcy (still not bankrupt), they keep shorting and shorting with those naked shares created to drop the price, once they used a share too many times (too many IOUs) they either pack them into trust bonds (for more liquidity for fuckery) and sell them or dump them into a bank ETF (that also tanks the price in the main exchange while also "hiding" the naked shares).

Seriously Kenny?

Then they try so hard to bankrupt the company. The company shares are now worthless so they don't need to return any naked shares they produced (and I think they don't even need to pay tax on the difference they make). They made a shit ton of money on betting against the company with options (puts) predicting the company is going down while manipulating the price the whole time.

So Kenny has been shorting this companies for a reason: yes, it makes him a shit ton of money.

Is that his goal though? No.

His goal is to be the king of everything, to own it all. But how does shorting companies help him achieve that? Additionally, if he truly is shorting treasury bonds it is because he expects a lack of solvency on the part of the Fed.

so lets keep looking at how he does it. Bloody King of fake shares (nothing) Kenny. Yikes!

When the company is worthless it is then the best time for Shitadel to buy the business shares super cheap along with the real estate! They also buy the business debt providing leverage to the banks.

Bankruptcy is wonderful for buying real estate at a deep discount. We know he's gobbling up as much as he can get and land is a *tangible asset.*

They use third party real estate investment companies such IOR Inc (very very shady) that invest in real estate though direct equity. I'll share more details later on.

Let's continue...

So we know they buy the real estate, the assets, the shares but what we don't know is.... They also buy the business's debt (all dirt cheap!!). BUYING THE DEBT provide leverage against the banks.

but the bubble is bigger!

They have previously flooded the banks ETFs with heaps and heaps of naked shares and when the Kenny go to rebuy the company shares back from the bank the bank don't want to sell in a huge loss! (the company shares worth almost nothing!) So they keep the leverage.

But not only Shitadel is doing that,

All his friends are doing it too!!!!! (Melvin, Susquehanna and others). Shorting the government bonds and business debt means the have big leverage on the banks. Owning big pieces of the major banks means they own big part of the Federal Reserve bank (the machine that goes brrrrr).

----------------------------------------------

QUICK RECAP MIXING GME IN:

Draining money from the Businesses, shareholders and scamming people with his empty shells of TRUST BONDS. That's where the liquidity is coming from!

So where does GME come into play with this scheme? Ill elaborate lot more later on!

GME resisted and didn't break or bankrupt (thank you papa RC, DFV and every single one of you magnificent apes), instead it went up!

Kenny then tried harder and harder to break it (kept doubling and doubling down), but he didn't expect retail to be so resilient and not give up, also he didn't expect RC to come and transform the company!

RC did something that most of us don't see as a big deal, but is a MASSIVE FU**ING DEAL. HE GOT RID OF THE DEBT!!! Now GME is free!! Fuming bloody genius!

All power to the shareholders, power to the players!

Lets continue now!!!

THE MASSIVE REAL ESTATE SCAM!

--------- EDIT 3: I'm I Wrong?? HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE?

<https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds>

Am I a shill? Is this a conspiracy? There are no facts or proof? This hasn't happened before? Nothing to see here?

QaNoN tin foil???

If you don't believe me Check out this video from the Majority report on your tube. This has been uploaded today 2 of may 2021. That's after my first posts in here.

<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xIgseFCpc>

I'm not crazy, my mum got me tested!

This is a huge finding Thank you as always you beautiful Jtothetriple!!

<https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/03/lending-fraud-could-wreck-economy-again/>

The article states:

-   Loan originators, who made their profits on volume and pricing of loans, not quality. They misreported key financial information in [48% of loans](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/29/2/384/1903200) securitized by nongovernment agencies.

BOOM!

-   Underwriters at investment banks, who earned more by securitizing low-quality loans with high interest rates and marketing them to investors as high-quality. In legal settlements with the Department of Justice, many admitted they knowingly put false figures into prospectuses.

BOOM!

-   Credit rating agencies, which needed underwriters as clients. They often inflated ratings of mortgage-backed securities by adjusting their standard rating models. Without such adjustments, one study found, a top-quality AAA security would have fallen to a barely-investment-grade BBB.

BOOM!

-   The biggest fraud potential, Griffin said, is no longer with home mortgages. It's with other kinds of securitized assets, such as commercial mortgages. For collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), a kind of security backed by business loans, he's found evidence that [the underlying loans are riskier than the CLOs' ratings reflect](https://retirementincomejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SSRN-id3707557.pdf).

BIG BADA BOOM!!!

This is telling us that there is a MASSIVE scam going on!

[BOOM!](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/04/ken-griffin-goes-on-290-million-real-estate-spree.html)

[BOOM!](https://www.newsbreak.com/illinois/chicago/news/0NNQ2yrU/ken-griffin-invests-in-real-estate-tech-firm)

[BOOM!](https://www.ft.com/content/25e6100d-4cdd-45d0-aaab-6f9b77b14257)

No comments on the deals? All the real estate deals "Personal investment" and no other comment?

Kenny seems to go on real estate shopping's spree quite often!!

Ohhh wait a minute!!

I almost forgot that HE CAN GET LOANS to buy REAL ESTATE and put TRUST BONDS AS COLLATERAL!!!

How? Using those third party realty investors!

Basically give the BAG to the bank and leave them HOLDING IT!!

Guess who has a SHIT TON OF REAL ESTATE???

You guessed right!!! GME AND AMC!!! Woooohoool

<https://outline.com/pTpkmm>

SO where is the bubble?

Like professor Jhon Griffin said on that glorious article.... Some institutions are BACKING their loans with "AAA" bonds thats really are "BBB".

I bet if those banks open the bags of Kenny's Trust Bonds THEY ARE GOING TO FIND OUR PRECIOUS GME NAKED SHARES IN IT!!!! MADE UP MONEY!!

EDIT:!!!!------- THERE IS MORE!!!!

WAIT WHAT??

I think they are doing extra fukery here with the real estate and the banks based on the article here!!

I found this little article on the floor of the internet!!

<https://theintercept.com/2021/04/23/deconstructed-whistleblower-financial-crisis/>

This article says that commercial mortgages are being resold, but the borrower's info is being inflated to make the mortgage more valuable to the new buyer.

Ohhhh opportunity for fukery I see!!

crazy talk over here.... So what they could be doing is... follow me on this one

Is it possible that leased real estate from those companies they are trying to bankrupt can be collateralized for loans by a third party?

YES!

So.....

They buy the property (not from game stop but form the current owners of the real estate) with a loan trough a third party realty investor that uses equity to get the loans (the property appraisal then is inflated so the loan is higher).

They get the loan for the appraised amount first and put the current GameStop lease as collateral. No liability for Citadel, is using a third party, equity from non existing money (the trust bonds money) and the current GameStop lease as collateral (GameStop is not planning to move or leave for a while!)

Whith the bigger loan they buy the property cheaper (at the price really worth not the inflated appraisal price) and pocket the difference.

Once GameStop bankrupt then the they stop paying the loan and let it defaults, the collateral is gone!.

Now the bank has to sell the property (usually action), citadel uses the third party again and buys the property dirt cheap at auction with equity again (yup money from the trust bonds!) at lower prices.

It's a delicious double wash! BOOM! 🤯

BOOM!

They don't buy the real estate directly tho. They are using this CITY TERRACE LLCand others, this is how I connected citadel with them

I started here

<https://opencorporates.com/companies?q=CITADEL+SECURITIES+LLC>

After following the Dallas TX address lead me here

Then got here: <https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/5634119>

1999 BRYAN ST STE 900 DALLAS TX 75201 - 3140

That Address connects directly to this address

3700 N. Capital of Texas Hwy Ste 420 Austin TX

This one has a bunch of shady real estate companies all "working" out of a tiny office.

HPI real estate and others too.

The connection is the realtor Aubrie Kudrick...

The whole thing is very shady with other companies like this beauty here:

IOR - Income Opportunity Realty Investors

-IOR Inc. is an externally advised and managed real estate investment company. Co. is engaged in the business of investing in equity interests in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships, and financing real estate and real estate-related activities through investments in mortgage loans. All of Co.'s real estate is located in the southwest region of the continental U.S. The land portfolio is Co.'s sole operating segment. As of Dec 31 2010, Co.'s land consisted of 203.3 acres of land held for future development or sale, including a storage warehouse.

Their Website is laughable (honestly I think a 10 years old will do a better job) <http://www.incomeopp-realty.com/index.html>

Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. (Pillar) is the Company's external Advisor. Pillar locates, evaluates and recommends real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities and arranges debt and equity financing for the Company with third-party lenders and investors. The Company's land consists of approximately 131.1 acres of Land.

Look who owns them IOR. This is the whole list. <https://imgur.com/1YUwogo>

pillarincome.com

So. Their Coportate Break down. - <http://www.pillarincome.com/?page_id=26> Regis Property Management, LLC, Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc, American Realty Investors, Inc, Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc., Southern Properties Capital, Abode Properties.

So the first beauty will connect you into a web of other very suspicious to the eye real estate investment companies, go check yourself. YOKESS!!

This is a chance for a diligent ape to enfold this web of possible fuckery!.

Btw, if you look at deeper you will find out that the people that manage these realty investor companies they all manage like 50+ different business!!

EDIT 7: more shady connections

This set of images I uploaded spells out the story of IOR and TCI

<https://m.imgur.com/a/ubbX6vS>

That is IOR. Income Opportunity Retail Investors, with no property and no employees.

This is TCI.

<https://imgur.com/a/Qgolnag>

Negative quarter from loss on Foreign Currency Transactions. How much foreign money are you dealing with for apartment complexes 🤔

TCI owns most of IOR. TCI and IOR have the same CEO. Might be worth noting that Goldman Sachs and BoA both filed 13Fs in February liquidating their holdings

This doesn't make sense!! Please investigate

Let's continue!!

WHY DOES KENNY WANTS TO BE A BANK SO BADLY?

A state bank is lot less regulated than a federal bank.

A BANK IS THE ONLY PIECE MISSING IN KENNY PUZZLE

This way he will eliminate the middle man, the bank does everything for his fuckery.

Having a bank means, he will be the one setting the price of the appraisals, also giving the loans, then also liquidating the asset and auctioning controlling the prices to buy everything at the price he wants.

Being able to always inflate the appraisals and pocket the difference everytime more and more!

And buying the real estate dirt cheap always! Perfect set up!

Ohhhh the banks game!!!

HOLY ACTUAL FUCK!!!!

I'm going to put this information in PART 3 END GAME SECTION. So if you already read it just SKIP IT

KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD

A fellow ape dropped this little document in here that pretty much connected the pieces of the puzzle (confirming they are using bonds strips as collateral to sell overseas in different currencies):

<https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/>

With part of the scam money, Kenny and friends are funding heaps of companies in different countries: Brazil, Portugal, Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, Spain, Mexico, Virgin Islands, Philippines with a high interest rate of over 12% and receiving Treasury bonds strips (or assets) as collateral and huge leverage. At the same time they are taking advantage of the exchange rates to make huge $$$ out of it.

----------------------------------------------

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE COMPANY GOES BANKRUPT??

Lets say the company goes bankrupt. We already know what happens in the BANKRUPT MORALS AND SCHEMES section right?

This is Kenny's personal vendetta against banks in a bid to own everything!

To be the biggest king in finance by owning so many companies, so much leverage in the banks while using the money he makes with the naked trust bonds to buy land (not just from the businesses), [real estate](https://therealdeal.com/2020/08/27/ken-griffin-is-approaching-1b-in-worldwide-luxury-real-estate/), [art](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/18/ken-griffin-spent-500-million-on-two-paintings-sources.html) and also lend money to companies overseas. Remember Greensill???

Kenny's babies (Melvin, Susquehanna and friends) now also have massive leverages and are doing the same!!! Kenny style!

So Kenny ultimately wants to own everything, be too big to be untouchable and bigger than any bank or the Federal Reserve. He's been doing this trick pretty much since 2008 with this predatory behavior!!!

Another piece of the puzzle...Shitadel and friends are part of the DTCC but so are big banks!

Makes sense to me why the DTCC is now making all this rules (I'm looking at you juicy 801/002).

To protect the banks from Shitadel and friends predatory behavior as well as them not to suffer when Shitadel and friends fall due to GME!!! DTCC is not on the wrong side of the equation, they were just manipulated by Kenny big time! [Bloody scammy Kenny!](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-griffin-reaps-windfall-from-companys-bond-sale-11569262332)

------------------------------------------------

THE PANDEMIC STIMULUS: The beginning of the end of Kenny

During the pandemic the government needed tons of money (Maybe trillions 🤷🏻‍♂️) for stimulus and other things.

Edited:

The government issue bonds at very good rates in order to gather money for the stimulus fast.

Remember Kenny has been selling his trust bonds full of short naked shares? THATS HIS INFINITE MONEY GLITCH!!

speculation time

Blackrock and big 0.01% maybe were illiquid and didn't have all the trillions needed for the pandemic aid, that's why issuing all those bonds at good rates was a good fast way to raise money. (remember they been manipulating libor and lending money left right and center!)

"(Reuters) - Citadel Securities says bank pricing models were more of a problem than balance-sheet constraints when the U.S. Treasury market suffered from extreme illiquidity and volatility in March."

<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-pricing-idUSKBN2342VNg>

Wait..... MARCH!!! I WONDER WHEN THE MOST FUCKERY IN GME HAPPENED?

I'm dumb but might of being around those times?

Maybe just maybe they over short GME to get those juicy Treasury??

Maybe too many coincidences and right timing?

Check this tweet from DR MICHAEL BURRY

<https://imgur.com/gallery/vivSs5f>

So guess where the money for the stimulus came from?

Kenny!!

He bought those treasury (bills, notes and bonds) especially those juicy 10 year bonds!

They kept releasing all those bonds back then because the machine was going brrrrrrr non stop.

Kenny has been buying those bonds for a while! One of the ways he's washing the money from the naked trust bonds full of shorts.

Pure crazy talk speculation!! I'm just a dumb crazy ape throwing crayons to the air. Or maybe not, time will reveal 🤫 but makes fucking sense right?

KENNY FUCKED THERE BIG TIME.

I think when he saw the opportunity of those BIG FAT BONDS! he put the glitch machine to work overtime

CAUSING TO OVER-SHORT MANY COMPANIES ESPECIALLY GME

That's where everything went wrong with him, he went too big on GME and burry saw it, DFV saw it!

Jummmmm!!! Makes sense?? No?

Facts? No!?? I'm just connecting the dots!!

-------------------------

Now Kenny has all that treasury to play with. Ohhh no!

Play time for Kenny! Kenny took those bonds and what he did? and shorted the repo market!!, he shorted the treasury (mainly the 10 year bonds Michael burry been warning us about)!

I think burry and DFV have been on to him!!

---------------- BONUS

Tin hat on!

Check the spreadsheet in the background of the DFV goodbye video, check those companies.

Now tell me if those companies are not huge in real estate?

Now tell me who has a lot of shorts on those companies? SHITADEL?

Wait..... I'm not so crazy now right??

Tin foil hat off

-------------------------

But why?

He knew about the changes from libor to SOFR!

He knew banks were in trouble and he even admitted it!!

Remember?

"(Reuters) - Citadel Securities says bank pricing models were more of a problem than balance-sheet constraints when the U.S. Treasury market suffered from extreme illiquidity and volatility in March."

<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-pricing-idUSKBN2342VNg>

He know the bubble in the market, he has a massive leverage on the banks and also a massive bubble in the real estate!!

------ BTW: there is also a bubble about to collapse on the ETFs web. That one is about to explode soon!

He knew a lot of banks are gonna struggle and possibly get margin called for all those years of been manipulating Libor! When they change to SOFR (Read part 3 to fully understand).

Also he owns both sides of the leverage, he's shorting because he things the government is gonna struggle or even default soon so he shorted, then he has the leverage with all those bonds to ask for favors or just wait until until the market recover and win washing the trust bonds into juicy 10 year bonds successfully!

------------------

KENNY'S FUCKED UP!!

He fucked up with GME.

If Kenny succeeded bankrupting GME, he efficiently would of succeed in draining a billion dollar company, taking a shit ton of money from retail, scamming the people he sold those trust bonds as well keeping the assets and team state of GME.

Also getting away with overshooting a company in order to buy treasury washing that money and the money changing hands successfully!

Why GME??

speculation based on actions, timing, events and behavior by all parties

Because he is targeting BRICK AND MORTAR companies to wash the money in REAL ESTATE!

He needed extra money to buy those treasuries in bargain and over short GME!

Shitadel was shorting GME for a while and DFV knew that, They also thought it was a sure deal!

Also,

He uses real estate to wash the trust bonds. He is buying real estate using stock and derivates as collateral!! (With his non existent shorts!!!).

So be bankrupts business based on real estate to then reabsorb all those assets and wash the money!!

There is more of this fuckery later on!!

He's a parasite in the market inflating companies (with naked shares inside to then bankrupt them), successfully destroying the economy, stopping technology and so screwing many people that is struggling and unemployed! (Savirour of the people right?)

*Really Kenny?*

He also lent more and more money overseas to win with the transaction rates and the juicy 12%+ interest rates. Then wanted to cover everything and blame the PANDEMIC! When those business fail then he will also buy those business, the REAL ESTATE overseas and have leverage on every bank in the world that way!

Massive global scam Kenny! Exposed by a fucking Melon?

KENNY FUCKED UP in GME big time!

He overshorted GME thinking was a sure deal and not calculating the risks. HE MESSED WITH GAMERS!!

My logic (watching his videos and history of Reddit messages in the past 2 years)tell me that DFV was looking at GME for a while (burry too, I don't mean they communicate or talk) and when he saw that shitadel (and friends) increased their short position heaps, plus he saw following Dr Michael Burry tweets <https://imgur.com/gallery/vivSs5f> (he was listening to burry, finally someone did), he bought the long calls

That makes complete sense to me!! The company was greatly undervalued and wasn't going that bad really. I saw his entire analysis and hypothesis.

Check it out <https://youtu.be/GZTr1-Gp74U>

------------------

So for Kenny to keep succeeding, he needed to stay quiet, but he woke an army of APES!! He woke up retail!!

Also now 0.01%, the government and banks realized that GME wasn't going bankrupt and that Kenny has been scamming like that all along!! The shit pop out of the lid! And leaked too much!

After reading this (HOPE THE MEDIA AND THE SEC READS IT).

Maybe, just maybe they don't know! Maybe I just figure Kenny's game and I'm first to the punch!

Whatever it is, we need to expose this everywhere! This needs to stop! This parasite in the market and economy needs to stop! Spread this!!! Is your responsibility to be loud!!

The 0.01% want their money back, so are apes!!

Let's climb back what Kenny has been stealing from APES FOR YEARS!!

----------------------------------------

Take a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!

Ohhh Kenny, how the fuck did a melon discover your fuckery?
