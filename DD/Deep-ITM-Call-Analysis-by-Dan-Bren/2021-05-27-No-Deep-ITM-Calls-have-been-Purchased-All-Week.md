No DEEP ITM Call options on Monday but some interesting action with some (potentially bullish) DEEP OTM calls.

Tuesday GME Biggest Options Trades 5/25/21

Once again no DEEP ITM call options but some more action on both the $800 call (which we saw on Monday) and the $370 call. We shall see if these become resistance levels in the future.

Thursday GME Biggest Options Trades 5/27/21

Today contained one large block purchases of ITM calls but I wouldn't completely consider this a DEEP ITM calls like we saw with the $12 and $15 calls in the past. This was a purchase (or sale) of 200 of the $130 call. Other than this a pretty uneventful day in terms of large block purchases of options.

I won't keep you all any longer. Its an honor to be back and appreciate all the kind apes who reached out to check in on me. The community around here is what makes this place special. I hope you all have a great rest of your night. [u/Dan_Bren](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dan_Bren/) out.
