EDIT 1: There is an issue with Reddit right now and my images are not loading. I've added IMGUR links instead. Furthermore, I cannot see the upvote total for this post, which is still stuck at 1.

EDIT 2: The comments in EDIT 1 seem to be fixed now. I also added an example of how the additional deposit could have been made in shares rather than cash. This would force the short seller to buy enough shares to meet their new margin requirement. Otherwise, it was a legitimate margin call to cover a short position.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

There are significantly underfunded short positions on GME. With the recent spikes in price, it puts an even bigger strain on these positions because they must deposit more money to keep their accounts current with the new price. I'll use some simple numbers to describe what this means.

If you have $100 in a deposit account to "cover" your short position and the price skyrockets, you must make an additional deposit to meet the new price. So the account holder will deposit an additional $20 to make their account current. To do this, the short seller can either deposit shares or cash in their account. If you cannot meet this requirement, a [margin call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) will occur. I believe the uptick in volume this morning resulted from short sellers purchasing enough shares to meet the new requirement. It could also be from them covering the position, directly. I could be wrong but the outcome is still the same. Take a look: <https://imgur.com/vdzZUaa>

We had at least 2,000,000 shares traded within 20 minutes which boosted the price by roughly $45. This means there are now MORE positions which are underfunded and must make additional deposits to meet the increase in exposure. Ergo, we should have a domino effect. The "sideways" trading occurs between these purchase periods because retail investors continue to diamond hand their stonk.

What does this mean? Volume upticks like this will drive the price up. Once that spike is over, the price will trade sideways (basically) until another volume spike occurs. We know this because apes basically forgot how to use the sell button. This will send the price up again. Rinse, wash, repeat.

However......

Think back to the House of Cards - Part III. Remember the example I gave of Goldman Sachs when they were being "bought in"? What did they do?

They shorted EVEN MORE than they purchased on that day to keep the price down. As I am writing this, it is literally happening with GME.

I honestly do not believe this is retail selling, but rather, a flash-crash to drive the price down. I wrote about it in Citadel Has No Clothes when it happened on March 10th. I would have a hard time believing this a few months ago, but after seeing Goldman Sachs get caught doing the same exact thing, it's become obvious: this is their textbook move. The goal is to return the price to a point it was at prior to the increase this morning. Obviously, this will prevent more market makers & broker-dealers from having to make additional deposits.

This is not normal behavior and is HIGHLY unlikely that retail is responsible. Prepare for EXTREME volatility and know that these actions are performed to prevent OTHER BROKER-DEALERS from being margin called.

As you continue to hold, THEIR problem will become worse and worse. It will ONLY work if you sell. Once the short attack is over, you should see the price rebound. We know that $350 has been a dangerous point for them because they triggered a flash crash at $350 on Mar10 (Mario day). Low and behold, they *done-did-it* again

To me, this is us catching them in their lies. There would be NO NEED for this if their positions were covered. It is blatant market manipulation and we are SUFFOCATING THEM.
