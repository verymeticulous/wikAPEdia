Inspired by [u/swede_child_of_mine](https://www.reddit.com/u/swede_child_of_mine/)'s DD "The Sun Never Sets On Citadel -- Part 1" I digged into this. Finding a footprint in Germany. (DD-Link: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2xz48/the_sun_never_sets_on_citadel_part_1/>)

It's just a footprint.

The following are not my words. They are quotes from the linked sources. I don't add my own opinion and I'm not a financial advisor. I am just doing a brief summary of the source timeline in my own words.

TLDR: Source Timeline

-   2007: Berlin Stock Exchange took a majority stake in EASDAQ NV, which operated under the name EQUIDUCT

-   2009: EQUIDUCT enters into strategic partnership with Citadel Securities

-   2012: EASDAQ adds four new members to board (3 from Citadel)

-   2019: Tradegate takes over Berlin Stock Exchange

> Berliner Effektengesellschaft: What a story
>
> The shares of the Berliner Effektengesellschaft (BEG) are among the price miracles of the current bull market that are not quite as in the limelight as Lang & Schwarz or even flatexDEGIRO. Nevertheless: 90 percent price increase since November 2020 alone and a stock market value of around 935 million euros is more than impressive. The investment story is quickly told: The Berliners hold 56.2 percent of the Tradegate trading platform, in which Deutsche Börse AG is also involved. The number of securities transactions processed via Tradegate is currently soaring upwards that nobody would have thought possible. (translated from German Language)
