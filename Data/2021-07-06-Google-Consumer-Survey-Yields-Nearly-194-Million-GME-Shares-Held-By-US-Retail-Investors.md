Hello Everyone,

This pertains to $GME ownership among the U.S. adult population. If you'd like to know what this post is all about, please take a moment to hit up the original post below. It contains tons of info like methodology, links to result, surveys for other countries, research bias details, sample size calculators, other resources, and lots more:

So ... my follow on survey completed over the weekend, providing another 400 samples for a total of 700. I haven't checked, but at 700 I imagine the margin of error is around 3%. That said, I just wanted to provide this quick update with this larger sample as I know folks were curious.

FYI, as this is a randomized sample from a massive pool of participants, combining these sample in such a way is totally kosher.

Here's how things shook out:

~If I've made any math error in the above, I assure you it wasn't intentional, but I'd appreciate it if you could kindly point out my mistake so I can correct.~

I should mention that when I posted the initial results, someone reached out and said they started a survey to gather 1,500 samples. I reached out to this person a short while ago via PM, but haven't heard back yet. That said, since my 400 just recently completed, I imagine their 1,500 survey is still running strong. But I will update this post, should I hear back from them.

******If you have any questions or comments about sample size or methodology, I do ask that you please visit the OP first. Not on;y is there a ton of details in the post, there were also more than 600 comments on the thread with lots of great ideas, insights, suggestions, and just some very good discussion.******

Finally, this: None of what I am saying is financial advice, and I encourage everyone to do their own research when it comes to $GME, the stock market, and investing in general.

My personal advice: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. And as an aside ... if you have a guest in your home and they ask for some of your mayo, don't be a dick. Please share your mayo.

Edit #1: I guess I should post the survey result links here, huh? Sorry, there they are for anyone who wants to slice and dice the data:

Survey #1 (N=300): <https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&survey=sv2uhkuhypyl6olmiokx2zzkma&question=1&raw=true&transpose=false&tab=chart&synonyms=true>

Survey #2 (N=400): <https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&survey=gei6t23feekehqpuxr5woosr5a&question=1&raw=true&transpose=false&tab=chart&synonyms=true>

Edit #2: I heard back from the person who was running the 1,500 sample size, and it's almost complete (1,356/1,500). Below is a quick calc. of the current results, and the link to the survey for anyone who wants to play around and slice/dice the data. Google has a pretty good interface for breaking out demographics, etc.

So, without further ado ... this larger sample size results in:

Ownership: 5.6%

Avg. Shares: 32.5

As you can see, these results pretty closely align with the initial 700 sample (5.71% ownership and 39.5 share avg.) ... this larger sample size supports all the above results. The average share count has a little more flex than I'd like to see, but again, I've intentionally capped the count at 101 to guarantee a very conservative number here.

Here's a link to the survey (I'm not sure if the owner wants to be named, but I am asking ... if they are okay with that, I will update once I hear back):
