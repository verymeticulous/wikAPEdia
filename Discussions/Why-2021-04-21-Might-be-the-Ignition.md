January 22, February 19, March 5, April 16. The only options available in early 2020 and why tomorrow might be ignition.

I know, I know. Dates. Whatever. [Stay with me for a moment please.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuP2dOxhELQ) I have high confidence that we are going to see a repeat of February 24th, and the MOASS will start tomorrow. If not - that's ok. You can at least feel like a kid on Christmas Eve.

Edit: It has come to my attention by [/u/yelyah2](https://www.reddit.com/u/yelyah2/) that not all of these options were available in 2020. And that my date of Jan 22 should be Jan 15. The january data is hard to work with because we had massive retail buy pressure, and the Elon Musk tweet, resulting in a skewed result compared to February 24 and March 10. January realistically should have ended in the $80s range I think, based on where the stock has trended until now. However, the pattern still stands in my eyes. It could be that Jan, Feb, and Mar spikes were caused by new shorters entering due to Citron and that the original shorters (Melvin, Citadel, Point72) piled into April 16, 2021 because that was the LATEST option of 2021 offered. Meaning that the boom tomorrow (if it happens) will be INSANE.

A LOT of information has been pouring out since Friday. A few theories I've seen are a bit Qanon and wild. Let's not overthink things. I want you to take a step back and look at four dates:

January 22, 2021

February 19, 2021

March 5, 2021

April 16, 2021

Now - what is so special about these dates? These are dates in which options have already expired this year. The important thing to note is that these options were the only ones available to open between January and April in early 2020 which expire in the year 2021. (See edit)

Let's say you're a hedge fund and it's March of 2020. You think Gamestop is going to go under. In fact, you believe it will go bankrupt by April 16, 2021. Why? That's the closest date following earnings and bond maturity. COVID had just hit and in your head it's a done deal that they will be dead by then. You load up on PUTs for April 16, 2021 and maybe sell some naked CALLs to squeeze money out of "suckers" who buy them from you. You decide to also sprinkle in January 22, 2021, February 19, 2021, and March 5, 2021 options, but most of your ammo is on April 16, 2021.

Time flies by, and by the time January 22 hits, your PUTs are now deep OTM and your naked CALLs are bleeding money. Boom. Those all expire. Monday rolls around and the timer starts (T). Two days pass by (T+2) and it is now Wednesday, January 27th. Your shares must be located and delivered. Now. Remember what Robinhood did? They shut down buying because the buy pressure at this time, coupled with option expiration was about to ignite everything.

Things died down. It was looking more promising, but the price was still way too high for the shorters at >$40. February 19, 2021 arrives. Once again, their PUTs expire deep OTM and naked CALLs bled money. Monday rolls around, the timer starts ticking.... T+2 hits on Wednesday, February 24th and we see something crazy. In the last hour and a half of trading the stock climbs, and climbs and continued into after hours. What the hell was going on? There was fantastic DD posted about FTD loop and I honestly believed it when I saw this surge, but I think the answer is really simple:

These four option dates will all result in a T+2 bomb igniting on the Wednesday following expiration.

Same story for March 5, 2021. Options expired. Monday arrives, the timer ticks. T+2 of Wednesday, March 10th things are going up. This is it!! I was excited as hell that day. Then suddenly a flash crash snapped the price down. I believe that this was coordinated by the members of the DTCC in order to provide more time to get rules into place. They did not want this to ignite prior to April 21st.

Now, we're sitting on April 20th, 2021. Remember, the shorters most likely put the majority of their ammo into April 16, 2021 options because that was the best possible date to bet on bankruptcy. It was also probably the last of their ammo because there was no reason to bet on a date past April 16.

Monday, April 19th, the clock started once again. Tick.... tick... tick.

T+1 just passed by. Tomorrow is T+2. Wednesday, April 21, 2021.

We saw much activity over the weekend at Citadel and Banks around the world. There is a "guideline" to banks and members of DTCC to have liquidity for their positions that were loaned out by April 22. If things ignite at close of market or close to market close, then the April 22 date makes sense. Have liquidity BEFORE market open of the 22nd.

Supposedly BoA and others have emergency shut down their US branches as of close of business today. They must be preparing for something tomorrow. We might see stability throughout the day until around 1 1/2 hours before market close, and then.... rockets.

I am not a financial advisor. This is all theories. But I wanted to share my thoughts. I would also like to point out that tomorrow is National Banana Day in the USA. Cheers.
