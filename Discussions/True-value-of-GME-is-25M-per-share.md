Apes, we have another and even bigger glitch in the matrix. I was going to wait until Friday to post an update on further glitches this week as I believe there has to be something to them but this to me is too huge not to share and to hopefully bring more attention.

EDIT: I changed this flair to discussion rather than DD and as I mentioned below in this post this is a THEORY based on linear maths to show $25m+ is POSSIBLE not destiny! I believe it's important to understand the squeeze in theory is infinite if these numbers being shown in the "glitches" do mean something. They could mean nothing but if you can't grasp the implications of billions or trillions of possible traded volume on a company that only has 70m shares in existence with roughly only 48m shares actually being able to be traded publicly then you'll never see 100k, 500k, 1m+. Please read my post in full and I also suggest reading the other links I've posted as well before commenting you crazy fucks.

Before we go any further I will say this, this is research but it is also speculation this is in no way definitive but it is my personal belief that everybody is seriously underestimating the banana tsunami that is coming. Think about all the other times wallstreet has crashed. It was vs bankers, other hedgies. The transfer of wealth has always been a battle of the elites being greedy just swinging their dicks around. They are used to battling each other, they have never engaged with lowly apes. They should've dealt with the first few apes when they had the chance but they didn't. They were too arrogrant and now diddy kong is looking like king fuck your wife kong and he likes the stock.

Here is the link to the previous DD that I had worked out using the strange glitches we saw last week that totalled 1.2B, which lead me to believe the true value of the stock last friday was $7,227.83

This is another incredible bit of DD from another wrinkle brained ape who seems to think very similar to me, multiple apes working individually but coming out with very similar results to me with slightly different methods, sounds like good news to me.

In an effort to be transparent and to allow Apes to think for themselves here is a counter bit of equally fantastic DD that suggests these glitches are something else, I like both theories and both suggest GME go BBRRRR.

NOW I want to thank and credit [u/TDETLES](https://www.reddit.com/u/TDETLES/) and [u/DrPewNStuff](https://www.reddit.com/u/DrPewNStuff/) for bring this to my attention and allowing me to expand on my previous theory.

[What the fuck have they done.](https://preview.redd.it/euhbcikdc8q61.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=26510b30cc4943fa36721145789b6fc2ca3ed65d)

4.29 Trillion... yes TRILLION! You can say this is a glitch it means nothing, if that's what you choose to believe I personally don't see how we can be seeing glitches at this level. How can a stock with less than 70m shares in total be showing glitches into the billions and now trillions worth of volume.

Just like last time I recommend people watch this.

Ok so using my previous DD as the base for this and what impact 1.2B would have on the price

94m in volume from the trigger price of $46.12 lead to a price increase to $184.68 - 300.434%

1,201,846,831 / 94,189,110 = 12.75993404

That suggests that we could expect a price increase 12.75x bigger than the 94m volume.

4,290,000,000,000 / 94,189,110 = 45,546.67

This suggests a price increase 45,546.67x bigger than the 94m volume.

[I'm not fine. I'm never going to sleep again.](https://preview.redd.it/519d5c7le8q61.jpg?width=183&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc973fe7bcd24dd88046a04b3d5b141f01c71239)

This is what I thought we were dealing with...

300.434 x 12.75993404 = 3833.518

A 3833.518% increase on $183.75

$7,227.83

Now the update....

300.434 x 45,546.67 = 13,683,767.26

A 13683767.26% increase on $183.75...

$25,143,922.35

Now this is a theory based on the 4.29T volume and the price action being linear to the last jump we saw of over 300%. Nothing in the stock market ever works this linear I am not saying I'm 100% right on this and I encourage discussion. What I'm saying is that we have all potentially vastly understimated just how big this is through ETFs, FTDs and other hedgefund fuckery the true volume of shorts is into the trillions.

When I post this price of $25,143,922.35 that is based purely on the math. If everybody diamond hands this COULD go MUCH HIGHER!!! There is no limit to the price of the stock. I don't want to hear anyone talking about "oh but the market cap" "ha so you think GME is worth more than the planet" Shut the fuck up. This isn't a value play this is hedgies potentially shorting this thing all the way to the moon and catapulting apes into another fucking dimension. I'm going to open a bottle of top shelf whiskey... I will see all you diamond apes on the moon.

Apes set high scores.

TLDR: Hedgies are going to jail, they may have shorted this over 4T times which is driving the price down to $193 when the true value is holy fucking shit my calculator just screamed at me, it's $25m per share.
