I think I figured out what DFV knows... and it's pretty simple.

If you look at the volume of options OTM on 4/16/21 you will notice that it is much higher than any other time throughout the history of the stock.

It is my belief that DFV knows that Shitidel has no long positions in GME and only has calls/puts and shorts on GME. When your options expire OTM and you have not other positions in the stock but shorts you literally have NOTHING.......

It makes sense as to why the shorts have been dragging it out this long. You never give up on an option until it expires. If there's a chance there's a chance and you still have skin in the game. But if your options expire OTM and you have no long positions in the stock (which Shitedel does NOT) you have no leg left to stand on and no more skin in the game. Nothing else you can do but cover your short positions.

This also might be why you see Shitedel working all weekend and all hours of the night. They don't have any skin left in the game and they don't have any more legs to stand on. They have nothing left to fight for.

The week of April 16, 2020 the stock was $4.85 per share and going down. Why not buy you puts then for a year (Doesn't matter it's going Bankrupt right) which all leads to 4/16/21. I think DFV knows this information and matched their puts with calls and being that he on the winning side of the equation he exercised his options and quadrupled down. He knows Shitedel no longer has any skin in the game and no longer has anything to fight for. The stock is not going bankrupt and they no longer have ANY positions on GME..

Before they lost their option positions they were able to use a technique called ARBITRAGE. Which basically means simultaneous buy and selling of stocks to take advantage of differing prices of the same asset. In a sense they could use the options they had to manipulate the price. NOW THEY DON"T HAVE THAT ABILITY AND DEEP FUCKING VALUE KNOWS IT!!!!!

In 2017 Hedge funds started shorting Toys R Us and in 2018 of March they went bankrupt. Looks like it take about a year to win if you're a hedge fund.

TL:DR Hedge funds have been fighting because they had a leg to stand on with their PUT options. They expired OTM last Friday and now they don't have anything left in the stock but their shorts. They cannot use Arbitrage to manipulate the price anymore because they not longer have a position in GME. DFV knows this and went stride for stride with them and is on the winning side!!!

FEEL FREE TO POKE HOLES IN THIS BUT DAMN ITS KIND OF OBVIOUS!!!

EDIT 1: I don't know what the fuck is going on with all the awards. I'm just a fucking idiot who thought of this on the treadmill. I have not awarded a single award but god bless it I have't ever seen so many.

I guess it's not bad for my first "these/DD attempt" 🤷🏻‍♂️

EDIT 2: I POSTED THIS COMMENT "I don't think they have enough to keep fighting. And I speculate that DFV knows that better than anyone." AND GOT THE ALL SEEING EYE AWARD WITH THE SIMPLE COMMENT "YES". Take it for what it's worth.

EDIT 3: I POSTED THIS COMMENT "Kind of scary how obvious it is.... LOL" I GOT THE ALL SEEING EYE AWARD WITH THE COMMENT "VERY SCARY"
