TLDR; Citadel's latest hire, Heath Tarbert is too interconnected to other parties for it to be NOT considered one conflict of interest after another.

I'm [/u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/) back for a quick update on recent developments. This continues in collaboration with my previous DD, "[CHAOS THEORY - The EVERYTHING Connection](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mokvhk/chaos_theory_the_everything_connection/)" where we discussed off-shore tax havens in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. More specifically how we're able to link companies like Apollo, Citadel, Tiger Global Management to places like the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands (just a reminder this connection in the Cayman Islands doesn't necessarily mean they're working with each other).

We also went over how there may be a larger agenda at play with BlackRock looking to [make a move on Credit Suisse now](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-blk-mulling-buy-credit-174205125.html), and how they've collaborated with the Fed over the last year getting to help manage the economic impact of the pandemic as seen in the quote below:

> The contract, posted on the website for the New York Federal Reserve, was made public [just days after the Fed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/blackrock-federal-reserve.html) announced it hired BlackRock's advisory business to run three programs aimed at stabilizing a corporate bond market that has been roiled by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Contracts for the other two programs have not been released.

In a related note, as it turns out Vanguard is one of the largest institutional holders of BlackRock ( thanks for pointing this out [/u/meatcrobe](https://www.reddit.com/u/meatcrobe/) )

🔎WITH THAT BEING SAID THIS STORY GETS DEEPER YET AGAIN 🔍

Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton (brought in during the Trump administration) just took a job at Apollo Global Management (which [Tiger Global Management] holds a 14.8% stake in, making them the largest shareholder of Apollo other than a private holdings company from Apollo themselves (BRH) (<https://fintel.io/so/us/apo>); don't forget that Bill Hwang is an alumni of the Tiger Group and the[mess he's been involved in](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-08/how-bill-hwang-of-archegos-capital-lost-20-billion-in-two-days) with Archegos and how they've screwed Credit Suisse).

Just as a reminder the former CEO of Apollo stepped down last month because of his ties with Jeffery Epstein. Here's the story from a couple weeks ago ago: <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/22/leon-black-quits-apollo-jeffrey-epstein-ties-inquiry> . This isn't conspiracy, it's fact. How is it not a conflict of interest when a former SEC chairman joins a hedge fund that has relations with a criminal?

Now lastly lets not forget about Mr. Heath Tarbert, who was the former chairmen of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) who just got hired by Ken Griffin as one of his Chief Legal Officers at Citadel not even 2 weeks ago. Heath had this to say about his friend Jay Clayton. 🤔

> "It has been an honor to serve alongside Jay Clayton. He is one of the smartest and most capable transactional attorneys in the country and an even better colleague and friend. As leaders of the SEC and CFTC, we have worked together closely to harmonize our rules where appropriate and hold wrongdoers accountable.

How much further does this go?

Directly from the CFTC site: <https://cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8310-20> . Still not a conflict of interest?

THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING THEM FROM CONTINUALLY WORKING WITH EACH OTHER TO CREATE FAVOURABLE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THEIR PARTIES.

_______________________________________________________________________

It's in my personal opinion that we're starting to see the bridges built, and it's team Citadel versus team BlackRock (I believe the Fed is on that team).

I think the light at the end of the tunnel is that Gary Gensler will take the seat in the SEC JUST a day prior to the share recall <https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/senate-set-to-approve-gary-gensler-nomination-for-sec-chairman-but-likely-for-brief-term/> he was the one that brought what happened in 2008 to light through his extensive knowledge of darkpools. He also has a deep background in cryptocurrencies from what I understand.

NOW get this; he's only stepping in until June when his terms will be renegotiated. It's quite concerning that he's making an appearance at this stage for such a short period of time.

TLDR; HODL FOR YOUR DEAR LIFE, THERE IS A FULL ON FINANCIAL WAR GOING ON ABOVE OUR HEADS AND GME IS THE GODDAMN ATOMIC BOMB 💎✋
