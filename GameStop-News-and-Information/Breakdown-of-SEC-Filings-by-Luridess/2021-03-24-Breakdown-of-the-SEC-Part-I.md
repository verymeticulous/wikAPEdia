*NOT FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. THIS IS JUST HOW I, AS A FELLOW APE WITH A LAW DEGREE FROM APE UNIVERSITY WHO ALSO READS SEC FILINGS FOR A LIVING, UNDERSTANDS THE INFORMATION IN GAMESTOP'S SEC FILING. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IN SHORT, I LIKE THE STOCK. 💎👐 🚀🚀🚀

*EDITS:*

1.  *edited chart for clarity. Blank boxes are intentional*

2.  *Added info from fellow apes, added TLDR summary at the top*

3.  *Some comments that the first letter of some sentences are missing. I can see the first letters on my laptop & my phone so don't know what's happening*

4.  *Some of you are asking stonk questions &possible stonk conclusions. I can't answer those because I don't know much about the stock market.*

5.  *Added to TLDR*

6.  *added user comments & removed replicated risk factors in chart*

7.  [u/The_Law_of_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/u/The_Law_of_Pizza/) *thinks* *I'm a* [troll/shill and this is a fake account](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs2e70o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *because they don't agree with my wording & I left out "subsequent events".* [YES, it's true that certain events that happen post-fiscal year end must be reported, like a change in accounting principles or a discontinued operation](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-13)*. I didn't include that & other nuances in my post because it's NOT relevant to this SEC Filing. I asked* [u/The_Law_of_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/u/The_Law_of_Pizza/), *who is apparently a Securities Lawyer, whether or not they can provide some definitive proof that reference to a post-financial year end short squeeze that may or may not happen is considered a "subsequent event" in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. If that is the case, then I will of course update/correct my post. But I personally haven't found any legal authority that says commenting on a potential short squeeze that hasn't happened yet, and may or may not happen, is a "subsequent event".*

8.  *added user comments to chart*

9.  *Updated TLDR summary on why GME overdisclosed*

10. 🦍s *I am legit overwhelmed by your support & love.* 🙏 *for the awards but save your* 🍌*for stonks. Y'all are making me emotional. Who's cutting onions in here? Stop it! I'll respond to all your comments now*,🙏

_______________

TLDR APE SUMMARY 🦍🦍🦍:

-   SEC filings are legally binding documents and the information within can be used against companies in court proceedings.

-   GME has no obligation to include any information about anything after their fiscal year, January 31, 2021, unless it's a ["subsequent event"](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-13). To my knowledge, unless someone proves me wrong, speculating on a potential squeeze that may or may not happen in the future does NOT fall under this category.

-   GME confirmed that as of January 31, 2021, the stock was shorted over 100%

-   GME included LEGALLY BINDING information post-January 31, 2021, specifically about its stock, price volatility, and the short squeeze.

-   GME is basically saying that they are not responsible for any potential short squeezes that may or may not occur.

-   GME IS NOT CONFIRMING that a short squeeze will happen, because no one can predict the future. They are just saying that it's a possibility.

-   GME DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

-   I'm almost 100% positive that their lawyers advised against including any post-fiscal information, because if I was GME's lawyer that is what I would have advised them in order to limit GME's potential liability, but the fact that it's included anyway, is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.

-   Why did they do this? Who knows? But this ape thinks it's to let everyone know what is going on, and to let everyone know that THEY ARE ALSO AWARE of what is going on.

    -   UPDATE: I also like [u/bigbrainbets](https://www.reddit.com/u/bigbrainbets/)'s [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs342si?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it expands on my initial theory of why GME wants us to know that they know what's going on. Apes strong together!

-   THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE OR LEGAL ADVICE OR MEDICAL ADVICE. JUST MY OWN APE INTERPRETATION. DO WITH IT WHAT YOU WILL.

-   I like the stock and I will HODL.

Good morning my fellow Apes 🦍🦍🦍

I'm seeing a lot of different posts about interpretations and posts about the Gamestop SEC filing and what it means. I'm pretty excited to submit my first DD and contribute to this sub in a meaningful way, because while I'm only a smooth-brained ape when it comes to the stock market, I have a few wrinkles when it comes to SEC Filings.

What is an SEC Filing?

Publicly traded companies are required by the law to disclose relevant information concerning their business and corporate structure. The information enables investors to understand the company's business model and helps them to predict the company's future performance.

The following are the most common types of SEC filings:

1.  SEC Filings Form 10-K (THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE INTERESTED IN TODAY)

2.  SEC Filings Form 10-Q

3.  SEC Filings Form 8-K

4.  SEC Filings Form S-1

5.  Form S-4

6.  SEC Filings Form 11-K

Form [10-K](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/sec-10-k/) is a report that gives a comprehensive analysis of the company. It includes a detailed summary of the company's results, [management discussions](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/mda-management-discussion-analysis/), and audited financial statements. Companies are required to submit this filing within 90 days after the end of their fiscal year.

*APE INTERPRETATION* 🦍🦍🦍:

-   *Companies with stonks need to make their financial info public, so that apes with bananas can decide for themselves if they want to keep or sell their bananas. Financial information includes things like profit, loss, any potential lawsuits, and risks to the company.*

-   *Companies file 10-k reports at the end of each financial year. These reports describe the activities of the last financial year,* *NOT ACTIVITIES UP TO AND INCLUDING THE DAY OF FILING (THIS IS IMPORTANT)*

-   *These reports are professionally audited and reviewed/filed by lawyers, because any incorrect or misleading information can lead to huge lawsuits.*

-   *INFORMATION IN AN SEC FILING IS THE MOST ACCURATE SOURCE OF INFORMATION YOU CAN FIND ON ANY COMPANY (unless that company is lying, which would be financial/business suicide).*

GAMESTOP SEC FILINGS FORM 10-K - OUTSTANDING SHARES:

*(Source:* [*2021 SEC Filing*](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/)*)*

> ☒ The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 31, 2020 was approximately $244.4 million, based upon the closing market price of $4.01 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. (For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)
>
> Number of shares of $.001 par value Class A Common Stock outstanding as of March 17, 2021: 69,935,828

The number of shares outstanding represents the amount of stock on the open market, including shares held by [institutional investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp) and [restricted shares](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) held by insiders and company officers.

*APE INTERPRETATION* 🦍🦍🦍:

-   *As of March 17, 2021, Gamestop has 69,935,828 Bananas*

GAMESTOP SEC FILINGS FORM 10-K - INFORMATION IS ONLY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME:

*(Source:* [*2021 SEC Filing*](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/)*)*

Everyone is excited about the Gamestop SEC Filing, and I'm seeing a lot of posts that, among other things, this CONFIRMS the percentage of shorts and other things.

THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCURATE, AND HERE IS WHY:

If you look at the TOP of the SEC filing, it clearly says

> ☒ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
>
> For the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021

*APE INTERPRETATION* 🦍🦍🦍:

-   *THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THE SEC REPORT ONLY APPLIES TO THE TIME PERIOD OF FEBRUARY 1, 2020 TO JANUARY 31, 2021*

-   *COMPANIES ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO REPORT ON ANYTHING AFTER THEIR YEAR END*

-   *THE FACT THAT GAMESTOP TALKS ABOUT EVENTS AND SITUATIONS AFTER THEIR YEAR END, UP TO THE DATE OF FILING, IS KIND OF A PRETTY BIG DEAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY FILE WITH THE SEC HAS TO BE ACCURATE AND IT'S A BINDING LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED AGAINST THEM IN COURT.*

Ape guesses that: Internal control refers to, among other things, their method of applying GAAP accounting principles to their Financial statements. Revenue recognition changed with the new 606 rules and how some is recognized (subscriptions, etc.). These differences can positively or negatively affect the company's financial outlook. If an external auditor found that some revenue or expenses were mis-categorized or used the old 605 rules as opposed to 606, this could materially ( *🦍* speak: largely) affect their financial statements. *🦍* Speak: Accounting rule changes could affect their reported numbers for the better or worse. | The manner in which we fund tax withholding obligations that will arise upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards may require us to use a substantial amount of cash, which would reduce our liquidity, or may result in sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock into the market, which could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. EDIT: [ReverseTickleMonster](https://www.reddit.com/user/ReverseTickleMonster/)[28 minutes ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs26vh2/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)'s input: Am Ape, not advisor. Ape guesses that: Because the 2019 rule is no longer referenced, I assume that they switched to 606 rules and this is no longer a concern. Now in 2020 They are concerned with setting aside an appropriate amount of cash to pay for taxes on vested restricted stock awards. The company can pay these taxes, or pass the tax bill to the individual if they so choose (unlikely). This is where we would look at available options for inside holders as well as institutional warrants. IF any are exercised that should create a taxable event. i believe that this is saying: *in the event that they have more restricted options/warrants exercised than budgeted, they may have to sell stock into the market to foot the bill*. However, exercising these options/warrants converts them into restricted stock, which wouldn't trade on the open market; this would lock these up for trading. Also keep in mind that they clearly state that they have SOME funds to cover taxes for this event already, which would more than likely cover the tax expense based on their prediction. *🦍* Speak: They are covering their base in case restricted stocks are exercised by insiders. This is not saying that they WILL sell shares to cover the tax obligations. It's saying 'Worst case scenario if we need more money for taxes, we CAN sell more stock to cover additional tax expenses. | *Can an ape with more wrinkles explain this difference?* |

GAMESTOP SEC FILING: RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:

*(APE INTERPRETATION* 🦍🦍🦍: *the factors in this list are NOT EXHAUSTIVE. the "without limitation" DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE VALUE OF THE SQUEEZE IS WITHOUT LIMITATION. They even put a COLON after the words "without limitation" which in grammatical terms, indicates the beginning of a list, and therefore it's A FULL STOP, like a period.)*

-   "short squeezes";

(*APE INTERPRETATION* *🦍🦍🦍: NOTICE HOW SHORT SQUEEZE IS IN QUOTATIONS? That means they are using a specific definition for it, and their interpretation of what a short squeeze means should be in the document itself. the interpretation is further below)*

-   comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media;

(*APE INTERPRETATION* *🦍🦍🦍: SHOUTOUT TO* [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) *AND APES!!)*

-   large stockholders exiting their position in our Class A Common Stock or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our Class A Common Stock;

-   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;

-   risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;

-   the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches;

-   the timing of new store openings or closings;

-   shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings;

-   the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;

-   acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in;

-   the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate;

-   the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores;

-   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

-   negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry; and

-   overall general market fluctuations

For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.

(*APE INTERPRETATION* *🦍🦍🦍: THEY ARE BASICALLY SIGNALLING TO US THAT THE PRICE VOLATILITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMPANY ITSELF, THE COMPANY HAS REMAINED THE SAME, AND THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE - THEY HAD NO REASON TO DO THIS. THEY HAD NO REASON TO INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IN THIS FILING, BUT THEY DID...)*

These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.

GAMESTOP SEC FILINGS FORM 10-K: A "short squeeze" due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.

This is often referred to as a "short squeeze."

(*APE INTERPRETATION* *🦍🦍🦍: THE LAST TWO SENTENCES IN THAT PARAGRAPH IS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF A SHORT SQUEEZE - notice the words "MAY", which means it CAN happen but it's not GUARANTEED, as opposed to using, for example, "SHALL" or "MUST")*

I hope this gives you a better understanding of how to read SEC documents, their significance, and things to look out for.
