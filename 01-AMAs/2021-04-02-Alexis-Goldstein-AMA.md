Hi all, Alexis Goldstein here. I'll be doing an AMA this Friday April 2nd at 11am EST.

EDIT: Hi everyone, thanks so much for hosting me here. I have to run (1pm ET). Thanks again for the discussion today.

A little bit about me: I currently work advocating for a safer and fairer economy. But I started my career on Wall Street. I worked as a programmer at Morgan Stanley in electronic trading, and as a business analyst at Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank in equity derivatives.

-   I recently testified before the House Financial Services Committee in their second hearing about GameStop. You can find my [written testimony here.](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-goldsteina-20210317.pdf)

-   I also discussed the GameStop situation on Twitch with AOC back in February. Here is a [clip of our discussion](https://boingboing.net/2021/01/29/aoc-learns-how-robinhood-makes-its-money.html).

-   Here are two recent appearances of mine on CNBC and BBC, both discussing GameStop:

    -   [Why GameStop is Goliath vs Goliath (BBC World News)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa7_KVfMuKo)

I write a newsletter about the financial markets called [Markets Weekly](https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/) 🦄. There, I've written about [GameStop](https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/), over-concentration of [Dogecoin](https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/dogecoin-elon-musk-and-questions-on-the-doge-whale/), and [Archegos](https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/archegos/).

Finally, I wrote a bit about the broader implications of GameStop in [an oped for the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/opinion/gamestop-biden-wall-street-reddit.html), where I argued that we can't beat Wall Street at its own zero-sum game. But we can change the rules.

I believe that truly democratizing the economy means pouring national resources into lifting up Americans and rebuilding public institutions. That looks like canceling federal student debt, which President Biden can through executive action, would grow the economy, relieve the [disproportionate debt burdens](https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/2021/01/sign-on-letter-over-325-orgs-call-on-president-elect-biden-to-cancel-federal-student-debt-on-day-one-using-executive-action/) carried by Black and brown borrowers. It could also mean examining policy changes like a modest wealth tax, a financial transaction tax, and creating programs like [baby bonds](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-baby-bonds-could-help-americans-start-adulthood-strong-and-narrow-racial-wealth-gap) to fight the racial wealth gap. Finally, I believe that regulators need to make sure that nonbanks like asset managers and hedge funds aren't taking advantage of regulatory blind spots to make themselves too big, or too interconnected to fail.

Thanks for hosting me! 🦄
