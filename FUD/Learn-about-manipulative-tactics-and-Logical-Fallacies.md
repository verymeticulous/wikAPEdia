APES WHO ARE GIVING THIS AWARDS. BUY MORE STOCKS OF YOUR FAVORITE COMPANY OR DONATE TO CHARITY. I LOVE AUTISM AND ADHD AWARENESS ORGANIZATIONS. EDUCATION IS ALSO GREAT

A potential shill erased all his posts regarding negative sentiment on $GME earlier. I asked him why he had deleted his posts. He hit me with he did not.

This is an obvious attempt at gaslighting, which is a form of unethical manipulation.

Please, be vigilant out there, apes.

A very easy way to spot shills is by looking at their submission history.

Bot accounts or people making accounts to sell will go into subreddits that allow karma farming like WSB and [r/FreeKarma4U](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeKarma4U/) delete those posts and act like it's because "they scrub their history". Fuck off.

Also, as someone commented, a related concept you should know about to have the above knowledge be even more effective is Cognitive Bias and the associated concept of Cognitive Dissonance:
