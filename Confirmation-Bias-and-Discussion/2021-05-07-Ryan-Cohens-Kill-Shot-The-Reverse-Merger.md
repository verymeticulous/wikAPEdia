What's RC plan, does he have a plan?

This Guy Fucks

Here is what I think Ryan Cohens plan is

[![r/Superstonk - Ryan Cohens Kill Shot....the Reverse Merger](https://preview.redd.it/e7c3rodiyrx61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=356944c81ec0e08be4da473605260def8e819f75)](https://preview.redd.it/e7c3rodiyrx61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=356944c81ec0e08be4da473605260def8e819f75)

REVERSE Merger

Ok I have heard allot of talk about stock splits, reverse splits, dividends or crypto dividends ect on how RC can shake the shorts.

None of those really go the whole way. Reverse split is out of the question as the stock is not liquid enough, and there is legal questions surrounding the crypto dividend. [OVERSTOCK](https://www.coindesk.com/after-lawsuits-and-delays-overstock-hands-shareholders-digital-dividend)

Also none of these moves benefit Ryan Cohen and GameStop at the same time. They may hurt the shorts or help retail investors but none of the options help Gamestop and RC at the sametime.

I have [Posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwy324/can_ryan_cohen_increase_his_ownership_to_199/) and others have thought about RC buying more GameStop, after reviewing the filings he can buy up to 20% of the company at any point. This whole time I have been waiting for him to buy, and thinking that he is waiting for volume to dry up, or to save his ammo to protect the stock if the price starts to fall.

but there is a serious flaw in that thinking......it doesn't help Gamestop.

I lay out the timeline of RC and GameStop below more in-depth below, but at this point RC has control of the board and the chairmanship, he doesn't need to buy anymore stock the way normal people do.

GameStop, with the help of RC and his marry band of Apes has erased its long term debt (minus leases) and raised 555m (a nice down payment on the transformation)

Ryan Cohen wants to own more of GME, most owner/ceo own over 20% of the companies they run.

He is totally invested in the GameStop turnaround, the best thing he can do is a Reverse Merger.

He capitalizes RC ventures with allot of money (500m, 750m, 1.5b) he can even bring in other private investors.

RC Ventures and GME merge, they create a Holding Company that they both merge into. The holding company is renamed Gamestop and eventually trades as GME under a new CUSIP#

How does it help Ryan Cohen- He gets ownership of whatever % of the stock at the agreed upon merger price (it would be the same amount as if he bought on the open market)

How does it help Gamestop- they actually get the CAPITAL, if Ryan buys on the open market they don't get the money they sold that stock when they issued it. this way Ryan gets to infuse the company with much needed cash and increase his ownership stake at the same time.

You are probable asking

HOW DOES IT HELP APE - Did you gloss over the part about the CUSIP#...here read this

[Example 1](https://groovevc.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-remarkable-short-squeeze/) or <https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/>

" Changing the stock cusip number results in each share with the old cusip number having to be exchanged for a share with the new cusip number, which causes each short position to have to prove the borrow. Naked short positions would be unable to comply and those positions could have to be covered by purchasing shares with the new cusip on the open market. "

Now the reverse split or the reverse merger has been tried before and it does squeeze the stock price a bit, but then it goes right back down. Typically this is because it is done on Penny Stocks and the shorts can simply cover as its not that expensive or there is not as many Naked shorts as people think.

but what if there is a ton of NAKED SHORTS, then those SHORTS ARE FUCKED. If they sold a bunch of shares naked and kept doing it without ever thinking they would need to be returned they would be foreced to buy a TON of GME under the new CUSIP #

There goal was never to cover

I have been writing a DD where I believe that Citadel and SUS has been stashing their Naked options sales or Naked short sales in [Sold not yet purchased liabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n6mj3h/knight_capital_groupthe_precursor_to_citadel_part/) which are Ballooning.

Oh and GME has done this before when the merged with EB games

[Gamestop EBgaming Merger](https://news.gamestop.com/node/11616/html)

They created a new Holding company like a laid out above

More Fuel for the Fire-

Ryan Cohen changed lawyers (DFV pointed it out in his tweets)

new lawyer.....rising start in Mergers and Acquisitions

<https://profiles.superlawyers.com/new-york-metro/new-york/lawyer/ryan-p-nebel/c6896fb3-ede6-4eca-8bbe-40b0dc317589.html>

He also has a team of lawyers but Ryans on the Filings now . [NEW TEAM](https://www.globallegalchronicle.com/gamestops-agreement-with-ryan-cohen-for-the-board-of-directors/)

Ryan Cohen has the Assets-

He sold CHewy for Billions....he bought two stocks Apple and Wells fargo (we dont know the ratio but articles point to it being heave on apple)

Do you like apples?

[![r/Superstonk - Ryan Cohens Kill Shot....the Reverse Merger](https://preview.redd.it/yx4fhnni0sx61.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=acecc5de4bd90ec5f9954cf3521f0c1cca8f88c3)](https://preview.redd.it/yx4fhnni0sx61.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=acecc5de4bd90ec5f9954cf3521f0c1cca8f88c3)

Ryan Cohen owns 6.2 million shares of Apple How do you like them apples?

Tinfoil Hat time-

Apple has been acting weird since mid February.

[Apple bought back 19B in March](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-giants-have-ramped-up-stock-buybacks-apple-is-the-champ-51619780412), the stock didnt pop up until they crushed earnings and annouced that they are going to buy back 90B more....and its dipping again.

I have been thinking it is Funds selling out to cash out or to cover your position. Probably covering the position as apple it is safe haven stock.

but what if it was someone ready to go .....all in on GME

yeah crazy theory
