[Education 👨‍🏫 | Data 🔢](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Education%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8F%AB%20%7C%20Data%20%F0%9F%94%A2%22&restrict_sr=1)

Apes, you ever held something for 6 months and wake up one day fucking sick and tired of Games Kenny plays? That was me on Wednesday. For the love of Harambe, I've had enough of the corruption.

Well, strap in. I'm jacked to my tits and I've got some dates for you.

Saturday June 12th-Tuesday June 15th- [E3, biggest gaming industry event usually with lots of good news and announcements. PC Mag has the deets for you.](https://www.pcgamer.com/e3-2021-schedule-dates-lineup/) Thanks to several Gamer Apes in the comments.

Rumor: managers at GameStop have been told to expect something big the 15th to coincide with E3 but haven't been told what. See comments.

Monday June 14th- Small T+21 FTD date from May 21 (according to some monkeys on Discord. Correct if wrong. It's not big volume).

Am leaving this so you can keep an eye on it but [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) may have disapproved his own FTD theory for the new, sexy, holy fuck net capital theory. [And holy fuck, I am jacked. Go read it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny2ov4/a_revisit_to_net_capital_what_is_truly_driving/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Tuesday June 15th- [Emergency Meeting at the Fed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxnyxf/emergency_fed_meeting_called_for_tuesday_june_15/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb) credit to Smart Ape [u/TreeSquid007](https://www.reddit.com/u/TreeSquid007/) for reading good.

*Wut doing JPow?*

Edit: apes in the comments say this is a normally scheduled meeting with standard language. But you know they are talking about us.

June 15th-16th- JPow do a meet about raising interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

To those of you who can only focus on the next date out of all the dates and rocket fuel here and have to comment, fuck off. Tell your wife to top up my cell phone so I can FaceTime her tonight. She keeps begging me to switch teams. She says you've got a tool you don't know how to use.

Now keep reading.

Friday June 18- [Quadruple Witching Day](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/q/quadruple-witching)

*What Is Quadruple Witching?*

Quadruple witching (also called "quad witching") refers to the third Friday of every March, June, September and December. On these days, derivatives (e.g. market index futures, options futures, stock options, stock futures) expire, usually resulting in increased volatility.

You know what I like? Volatility. You don't scare me anymore, Kenny. I'm into that shit. I've got daddy and mommy issues.

I know the last one was a letdown. Don't focus on one date.

Edit: Wrinkly Ape [u/Francis46n2WSB](https://www.reddit.com/u/Francis46n2WSB/) pointed out last Quad Witching wasn't normal and Kenny was stressed.

*The last quadruple witching day was not a letdown, it had an enormous explosion in volatility.

What happened was, if you check the charts you'll notice, Kenny and friends massively suppressed the the price so that the volatility wouldn't be noticed. I compare it to diving and laying over a grenade.

This time I think they're running out of stuff to contain the blast.*

Also on Friday June 18th [Some crazy junk bond shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns7k6q/could_gamestops_liftoff_unravel_corporate_junk/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) that everyone is balls deep in except us and Goldman Sacks. Thanks to Literate Ape [u/Get-It-Got](https://www.reddit.com/u/Get-It-Got/) for this one. Go put some wrinkles on this one. OP is asking for more eyes.

Also Friday June 18th- tons of SPY puts. Usually about a billion. At 60 billion. Thanks to SPY ape [u/rabsgood](https://www.reddit.com/u/rabsgood/). We aren't sure what this means. Could be nothing. Could be fuckery.

Monday June 21st- NSCC 002 most likely falls into place. You know what that means? More on NSCC 002 below. Marge is a demanding bitch.

Also June 21st- ~~Aussie~~ Ape Matt Furlong becomes CEO of GameStop.

Detail Ape clarified Matty isn't from Oz....just ran the Amazon for them for 2 years. 8 years total at Amazon. Welcome back to cold Christmas, my dude. I hear Texas has snow now.

Tuesday June 22nd to Thursday June 24th- Net Capital, aka margin call spikes. [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) has redone his FTD predictions to include Net Capital, AKA margin call requirements. [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny2ov4/a_revisit_to_net_capital_what_is_truly_driving/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Wednesday June 23rd and Thursday June 24- Big Wrinkly Brain Ape [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) says another FTD cycle. [Danger Zone 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwgzw7/danger_zone_part_2_shorts_are_terrified_of_a_310/) and [comment from today here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxajjj/comment/h1fns10) **see above for new Net Capital updates from criand.

Thursday June 24th- Kenny wants to look clean and tidy for FINRA. Cleans up his shorts to make a pretty for the paper. Short interest report day from [FINRA. ](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)often causes the price to rise. It's GME so expect it to fall, even if they reveal it's shorted 2000% (they won't). Thanks to new redditor [u/Superstonkfollow](https://www.reddit.com/u/Superstonkfollow/) for the message.

Look at previous FINA SI receipt dates. 27 Jan. 9 Feb. 24 Feb. 9 Mar. 24 Mar. 12 Apr. 26 Apr. 11 May. 25 May. 9 June. Overlap with the T+21/ T+35 on 24 Feb, 26 Apr, 25 May. [When the dates align, the wombo combo happens](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf22qz/theory_on_the_ftd_loop_missing_link_a_t35_surge/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=stocks&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_content=t1_h0qiqzc) [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) got another wombo wrinkle. Thanks again to [u/superstonkfollow](https://www.reddit.com/u/superstonkfollow/) for putting all that together.

Friday June 25th- JPow wants 715 BILLION in reverse repo payments back. [Holy Fuck. ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.pdf)Thanks to Detail Ape [u/aquadisaster](https://www.reddit.com/u/aquadisaster/) for the wrinkle.

Also Friday June 25th- Mr. Russell Gets a Extreme Stonk Makeover..... after hours. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxjvpg/gme_russell_1000_rebalance_day_and_t21_and_t35/) from Wrinkly Ape [u/vierzehnter](https://www.reddit.com/u/vierzehnter/) for in depth Mr. Russell wardrobe change analysis.

But the summary is this: paraphrasing OG Wrinky Ape d/lauer.....Russell rebalance is volatile AF.

Papa Cohen said to buckle up.

Monday June 28th First day of trading after Mr. Russell gets a makeover

AND

T+35 FTD date according to Math Ape [u/Unsure_if_relevant](https://www.reddit.com/u/Unsure_if_relevant/) Check out criands new [Net Capital 21 Day Loop here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny2ov4/a_revisit_to_net_capital_what_is_truly_driving/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

EDIT: wrong year. Another ape caught it. June 2023. ~~Wednesday June 30th-US switches from LIBOR to SOFR. Fuck if I remember what any of this means. LIBOR is the The London Inter-bank Offered Rate. SOFR is Secured Overnight Financing Rate.

This is the rate which determines how much it costs BofA to borrow from Wells, etc. Ape do a wrinkle and link and explain more, pls and thank.

New redidior [u/SuperStonkFollow](https://www.reddit.com/u/SuperStonkFollow/) linked me to Big Wrinkly Mod Ape [u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/)'s Magnum Opus [Chaos Theory involving LIBOR and SOFR](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and holy fuck. I can't sum it up. Go read it again.

Holy fuck moment: SOFR the last time it was attempted to transitioned into (in 2019) almost IMPLODED the market due to many realizing that banks and others could not handle a higher interest rate (based off the DAILY TRESURY YIELD RATE) versus the fabricated one that banks provide.

This can be postponed......again. someone call JPow and tell him we are done fucking around.~~

LIBOR to SOFR isn't happening until June 30, 2023.

But I'll still jacked.

Add this with reverse repo and I'm jacked.

Monday July 5th just a reminder the casino is closed ~~so that Kenny and Steve and Gabe and Mikey can have a much deserved day of rest~~ Murica celebrates its birthday, Bitches.

Wednesday July 14th GameStops NFT on E-network word I can't say ~~but I can't find thread. Linky me, pls.~~ High tech Ape says more [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nkzqyv/gamestop_crypto_or_nft_to_go_live_july_14_2021_at/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Friday July 16 [Crazy high option volume](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/)

Also Friday July 16th- crazy amount of SPY puts. Could be nothing. Could be sus. Keep an eye peeled.

Monday July 26th- 21 Day Net Capital cycle. Fresh off the press from criand. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ny2ov4/a_revisit_to_net_capital_what_is_truly_driving/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Monday August 16th- T+21 for the July 16th giant tidal wave of options

Friday August 20th- T+35 for July 16th tidal wave 🌊

Do you see why I'm jacked??

Now a note on NSCC 002/801 because everyone seems to be confused. This is *the* margin call rule.

Marge: Hello, Kenny? It's Marge.

Kenny, peeing his pants: Yes, Marge?

Marge: Pay me more money. You've got 1 hour.

No more days to fuck around and come up with funds.

Now I want to clarify here because I see a lot of misconception floating around this jungle about Marge.

When Marge calls, hedgies can meet their margin, meaning they can deposit more funds with their co-conspirators the DTCC and NSCC and keep on trading.

A margin call doesn't automatically mean default or MOASS.

Funny, cause if Marge calls my dumb ass I can't trade the rest of the day until I get my balance over 25k, so most likely out two days while my wire goes through. But Kenny and Steve and Gabe are special and previously they had days to meet their margin call.

Apes seem to think that when Marge calls, it's game over for the hedgies. Not true. They've probably already been margin called and met their margin requirements several times already. But now they only have 1 hour.

It's when they can't meet their margin calls that shit gets fun. Once 002 is in place, 1 hour. I expect to see more sell offs of their long positions when this happens. And I can't wait. Isn't Citadel long on Tesla and Burry short?

Now, when they can't meet their margin (or supplemental liquidity requirements) that's when they default. Default is what we are waiting for, my ape relations.

When default happens, that's when the DTC computer starts closing positions. Computer don't care how many zeros. [More about that process here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvrouv/i_feel_like_this_deserves_its_own_post_remember/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=mweb)

Also remember there are multiple hedgies playing fuck you in the ass here.

My guess (and I'm a dumb internet ape so don't listen to me or take this as financial advice) is that when the price skyrockets, the not quite as dumb hedgies will try to get out first and save themselves and add fuel to the fire.

Expect trading halts. Expect wild swings. Expect the rest of the market in the red and VIX going crazy. That's when you know MOASS is here.

Note I'm not saying MOASS will start when 002 falls into place. I'm saying 002 tightens the noose.

NSCC 002 is the rule that makes 801 actually work, in case you're keeping track.

Thanks to Smart Astronaut Ape [u/MoonTellsMeASecret](https://www.reddit.com/u/MoonTellsMeASecret/) for this [801/NSCC 002 Ape Guide Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5idj9/801_and_nscc002/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf).

Now some of you wrinkly brains are wondering where is DTC 005.

[u/Existing-Reference53](https://www.reddit.com/u/Existing-Reference53/) did an email [with the DTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where_is_srdtc2021005_the_update/) and they say it's being reformatted and posted soon.

DTC 005 is the rule that says Bad Kenny can't hide his dirty undies in the options anymore. Some apes say it's mission critical. Some say not. I'm too dumb to weight in on this.

Wut doing [Mikey](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)? DTC need to borrow my paid license for Microsoft Word to hurry up that formatting? DM me. I'll hook you up.

But I smell a fucky here. If it is the lynchpin and I was DTC Mikey and also a co-conspirator in massive fraud (Lawyer Ape Wes said trillions in fraud in our lifetimes) I would hold it back as long I could too. My guess is they are waiting for the first wave of defaults and it will magically be done with formatting. According to the emails once it's published it is approved.

Which leads me to this. My End Game Theory: No one wants to be a market manipulator or set off The Greatest Transfer of Wealth EVER. No one will force it. Not BlackRock. Not the DTC. Not GameStop or Papa Cohen.

It will happen when it happens. No dates, but taking all these things into account.....soon.

Kenny and Steve and Gabe and Mikey want it to be bad enough they can get a bailout. Then they can blame us.

[That scene in The Big Short about the bailout rattles in my mind.](https://youtu.be/RvI5mN3RIAI) Steve Carrell says "Paulson and Bernanke just left the White House. There's going to be a bailout."

[Guess where former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke works now?](https://www.citadel.com/leadership/dr-ben-s-bernanke/) He's probably helping write the bailout as we speak. Remember, this is bigger than Kenny and Steve and Gabe. This is also Mikey at the DTC. It's the prime brokers. It's the banks. The ones who allowed illegal naked shorting to happen.

Also. Don't forget. Fed Repo rate breaking records daily. Elliot Wave guy says up. Sign Guy is epic. DFV still in. Papa Cohen in the Cap'n seat of the rocket.

Your homework this weekend: hydrate. Play. Leave the basement and get some sun on your skin. For fucks sake, watch The Big Short if you haven't already. It's free in the US on Hoopla with a library card if you're temporarily broke AF (because you're about to be rich). If someone will willingly and enthusiastically consent to shagging you then do that too.

Film Noir Ape [u/Best_Account](https://www.reddit.com/u/Best_Account/) also recommends you watch [The Inside Job (YT)](https://youtu.be/T2IaJwkqgPk) and [Princes of the Yen (YT)](https://youtu.be/5-IZZxyb1GI) to the weekend watch list.

I also recommend Margin Call and Billions. And The Big Short book is even crazier than the movie.

If you've got any other important dates let me know and I'll add them here. Them just corrected to 🌝. It's a sign.

Past 4pm my time. Signing off for a strong beverage.

Buckle up.

TL,DR: just skim for FFS.

Lots of fuel in the rocket. Andromeda called. She's ready for the apes.

Thanks for all the awards! I've had so many anonymous ones I'm going to pretend both DFV and Papa Cohen have sent at least one each.

Edit again: Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ. I mention Quadruple Witching Day as 1 of 20 other dates with things going on and it's all some of you can see. STFU and read the rest.
