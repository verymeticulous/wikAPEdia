TL;DR: RC's tweets happen on days where large amounts of ETF FTDs are covered/delayed.

Hi everyone,

I've been diving into ETF FTDs for a while now and something finally clicked. *Almost every RC tweet happens on the same day a large amount of ETF FTDs are "cleared".* ETF FTDs are allowed to stack up for 3 days before needing to be handled. So when a specific ETF stacks up a decent chunk of FTD, puts are opened to delay 34 days, then RC tweets.

To show what I mean, I weighted the ETF FTDs by GME's weight within the ETF. GME is in a lot of ETFs, but these are the ETFs with significant enough FTDs: IWM, XRT, XSVM, FTXD, BUZZ, XSMO, IWC, FNDX, IJR, SPSM, SFYF, PSCD, SLYV, VXF, IJT, GINN, and VB.

Below is a heatmap of those ETFs. Each ETF is a different row, each trading day is a different column. The green color shows where a lot of FTDs are. The darker the green, the more ETFs. The blue marks a day where RC tweeted. If you look at a blue column and track it down, there is an ETF or two that had just cleared their stacked FTDs from the day earlier.

Tweets come the day FTDs are cleared - EDIT: outside of the fist emoji (DFV), flag (35 days before memorial day which had GME FTDS), job posting (35 days before June 2 runup), and one of the south park GIFs

I have an old post from May that claims the Ted tweets are referencing Rule 204: Close-out requirements, the rule the that specifies the thirty-five day cover period.

So using [my T+35 theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o155a6/t35_is_the_one_true_cycle_evidence_to_back_my/), I marked every trading day that came 35 calendar days after a tweet on the 4H chart. You'll see that most tweets end up corresponding to a jump in GME's price. Gray lines are tweets, green lines are 35 days after a tweet.

GME 4H chart with new tweets marked in gray and T+35 of tweets marked in green.

Not every tweet corresponds to a jump, but a lot do. The last few tweet's T+35 jump during after hours/premarket after the 35th day because technically they can be covered before 9:30 AM EST on the following day. Notice how a new tweet ends up being very close to the T+35 of an old tweet? To me this visually shows the process of kicking the can down the road. GME is getting suppressed pretty hard so let's mark 35 days after a tweet on SPY. You'll notice green days more consistently on SPY.

SPY 4H chart with T+35 of tweets marked in green.

Why is that? Because if a lot of ETF FTDs are being covered on these days, then a lot of underlying stock are being bought to return the ETFs. If a lot of underlying stock rises in value, SPY should rise in value too. GME is being shorted on these days, so it doesn't move much. But they can't short the entire market. I believe the sheer number of ETF FTDs needing to be covered every week is leading to the market inflation that has been seen for the past few months.

What does this mean for the future?

I've highlighted days where I expect upward GME movement. But since GME is being held down so much lately, I would expect more upward movement from SPY.

Red boxes on dates of T+35 from ETF FTDs.

That's all I got for today. I'm planning on dropping the ETF FTD DD tomorrow morning. It will go more in depth about the details surrounding this.
