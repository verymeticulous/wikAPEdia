Investigative Journalist Lucy Komisar

We had a fantastic time hearing what Lucy had to say about us and about the issue of naked short selling, offshoring, and Gamestop. She had this to say and I think it cannot be understated how BIG OF A DEAL it is that someone of Lucy's caliber, who has been watching this unfold for longer than a lot of us have been alive, has this to say about naked short selling and the GME saga;

"In the end, as we go down through the years, the decades, it ends with Gamestop."

*How's that for a hit of confirmation bias on your Saturday morning?*

🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂

KEEP THE AMA HYPE TRAIN ROLLING!!

🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂🚂

[Tuesday at 4:30 pm eastern we have Attorney Wes Christian](http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html)!!

📢[AMA QUESTION THREAD IS NOW LIVE! SUBMIT QUESTIONS NOW!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nczgbc/official_ama_wes_christian_with_special_guest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 📢

His primary focus in the last 11 years has been suing Wall Street for fraud.

Wes Christian is a Texas attorney with [an accent as big as his list of accomplishments](http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html)! Once again I'm going to [shamelessly plug the old documentary Wall Street Conspiracy](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU), where I first learned of Wes Christian along with all of the other OGs we've been talking to. And a fun fact... our former AMA guest and very favorite resident wrinkly brain, [u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/) has served as an expert witness for Wes multiple times in the fight against naked short selling. They go way back...

Which is why we're having [u/Dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dlauer/) cohost this AMA with his old pal Wes!! We are literally assembling the dream team here!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[did I mention Dave Lauer is one of us](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/naoqr9/bought_some_gme_yesterday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)?

The Wes Christian/Dlauer mashup AMA is next Tuesday, May 18 at 4:30 pm Eastern!!

Wes Christian

Here's what Dr. T has to say about how she first met Wes in her book, Naked Short and Greedy:

Chapter 3: A Sidewalk Café in New York. At the request of a business colleague, I have coffee with a lawyer from Texas who tells me that a problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. I feel a pang of guilt for not sticking it out to fix this before I left DTC in 1993. By 2003, it was a full-blown regulatory crisis!

The Napkin Story

*"One afternoon [in late 2003], my boss tells me he has just come from lunch with an old friend, Gary Jewell, a Houston-based lawyer. Gary said that he was in New York looking for someone who understands post-trade clearing and settlement, possibly someone who may have worked at the DTC. My boss recognizes the company name as part of my past work experience. He asks me to meet Gary over coffee. The two of them had run marathons in their younger days and my boss presents it to me as doing him a favor. Gary brought Wes Christian to that casual meeting.*

*James "Wes" Christian, is a Senior Partner at Christian, Smith, & Jewell in Houston. If not for Wes, I may not ever have become aware that the crack in the system Ray Riley brought to me in 1993 was becoming a gaping chasm in 2003. Wes was born, raised, and educated in Texas. He comes complete with a pleasant drawl that belies his non-nonsense approach to the matter. Wes would lead a team of 65 lawyers as he eventually uncovered more than 1,200 hedge fund and offshore accounts working through more than 150 broker-dealers to strip mall and medium size public companies of their value."*- Dr. Susanne Trimbath, Naked Short and Greedy.

We are so honored, humbled, and thrilled to bring you these top-tier AMA guests! If only we could go back and tell our February selves how far we've come 💖

What is short selling?

Dr T on Twitter: They just had a clue about GameStop on Jeopardy. The correct question was "What is short selling?" They asked better questions than Congress! Brava, Lucy Komisar!!!

A note from your friendly local Pink Cat 🐈

I want to say how proud I am of this community! The momentum has picked up, our bias has officially been confirmed, we know this is a matter of *wen* we moon, not if... all thanks to the overwhelming growth we've seen in the last couple of weeks and our amazing mod team. This is real, and you should feel confident in that as you peruse the sub, or as you interact with the people in your everyday life. *The only way the shorts get out of this like they always do, is by driving the company to bankruptcy like they always do.* And don't forget that GME paid off all its long term debt a couple weeks ago. Bankruptcy is *completely* off the table. In this unique scenario where we have the turnaround of a company with a dream team board of directors, the real unique situation here is THE APES ON REDDIT WITH DIAMOND HANDS.

Do NOT forget where we came from. 💎🙌🚀 That's what got us here, and that's what will take us to Valhalla. Trust the company's plan and HODL. The professionals we are bringing on for AMAs are providing invaluable confirmation and validity to our sub and to apes (and ants!) everywhere. The heart and energy of this sub is quite literally the catalyst. By you buying a stock in a company you believe in, HODLing with diamond hands, and VOTING YOUR SHARES, you are literally creating the MOASS.

Do you understand that?

🚀APES ARE THE CATALYST🚀VOTING IS THE CATALYST🚀

BUY. HODL. VOTE.

The catalyst really has been inside us the whole time. ✌

No date or meeting or rule or new CEO or merger or margin call or ANY OF THIS WOULD EVEN EXIST IF IT WEREN'T FOR DIAMOND HANDS. 💎🙌

Even Lucy Komisar believes in us!! WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK!! We have debunked every cult accusation and FUD tactic thrown at us since January. Is this what it feels like to ascend Mt. Olympus??

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
