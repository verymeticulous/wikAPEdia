Some of us have been here since before the first migration, and we have made many many friends along the way. As we sit here and enjoy this beautiful, enriching community that we have all collectively built, I just want to express a sincere thank you to everyone for being a member of Superstonk!! None of this would be possible without a whole lotta' dedicated apes. It's a deep fucking honor to be here with you all. 💎🙌

Hot'n'fresh DD by [u/Jsmar18](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jsmar18/)

[Demystify the Feds ON-RRP Operations, Why do we care so much about them? | Finally figured out what Michael Burrry IS trying to tell the world by u /Jsmar18 (link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oaw2ls/demystify_the_feds_onrrp_operations_why_do_we/)

As we watch the RRP levels rise to record highs, we are paying more and more attention to it because... well, why are they rising to record highs?! But this Hot'n'fresh DD that just dropped today from fellow mod Jsmar presents an enticing argument for why ONRRP rates may not actually be as big as we think, and that Dr. Burry's tweets seem to possibly confirm this theory.

Super dope read and we appreciate the work of wrinkly apes like J to educate us and provide such well-researched counter-thought to quickly established theories in the community!

FINRA issues largest fine EVER to Robinhood- $70MM

*Newsflash: Robinhood's Cost of Business is just Cost of Business. In other news, bananas are yellow.*

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat- Wednesday 06-30-2021- CELEBRATING 500K SUPERSTONK MEMBERS WITH FLAIRS!! 🥳🎊🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/9j2wlfrr7g871.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb6b784d292bac3f09cb72f416a8bd25b7058f3)](https://preview.redd.it/9j2wlfrr7g871.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb6b784d292bac3f09cb72f416a8bd25b7058f3)

Did you see those fucking RRP numbers up there? We are dancing with the Trillions here, and we're supposed to believe that $70 Million is a sufficient fine for someone who made billions off of PFOF?? Nah. FINRA can pretend that their Self Regulating ~~Organized crime~~ Organization (SRO) is issuing mind-boggling numbers here, but we have seen behind the veil and that's hardly a slap on the wrist- especially when a much lesser crime of stealing a loaf of bread would put the common ape in jail.

It has also been noted that this is not related to the taking away of the buy button in January. Robinhood just proved that this fuckery is part of their business model.
