🎮🛑GameStop News from this Week 📰

#GMERICA

fuck yeah

Gamestop has been busy filing trademarks around the world for "GMERICA".

Here's a map by [u/Matt_Madd](https://www.reddit.com/u/Matt_Madd/) showing where exactly the term has been trademarked:

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat- Week of 09-03-2021- Remember it's a 3 day Weekend for US Labor Day! 🍻](https://preview.redd.it/wur1dg6zlcl71.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd9bb9ce78d30cf60bad10c42df2254c7264a2d6)](https://preview.redd.it/wur1dg6zlcl71.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd9bb9ce78d30cf60bad10c42df2254c7264a2d6)

Here's an example of the Australian filing, posted by [u/Carola94](https://www.reddit.com/u/Carola94/) (all the registrations seems to contain the same info) which outlines the nature of the goods and services represented here.

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat- Week of 09-03-2021- Remember it's a 3 day Weekend for US Labor Day! 🍻](https://preview.redd.it/9zj6lah0mcl71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=413788810d09374ef2d42e7dace7b6019d723d11)](https://preview.redd.it/9zj6lah0mcl71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=413788810d09374ef2d42e7dace7b6019d723d11)

There are some theories that perhaps Gamestop will begin producing their own line of merch, which would of course be made in GMERICA fuck yeah

Or maybe they're creating an NFT marketplace for the purchase and resale of all things gaming?

Or maybe it's some hybrid creation of amazon/opensea- a marketplace for both physical merch and crypto stuff? I'M GETTING SO JACKED THINKING OF THE POSSIBILITES PLS HALP

Don't forget that [Gamestop themselves tweeted GMERICA on July 12.](https://twitter.com/GameStop/status/1414696625218342933?s=20)

Who knows, maybe they just trademarked it because they tweeted it and want to protect it from misuse. 🤷‍♀️

📰S&P 500📰

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat- Week of 09-03-2021- Remember it's a 3 day Weekend for US Labor Day! 🍻](https://preview.redd.it/6yv6ntj2mcl71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=90311fb91797b5ee8793a5f360b484aeb5d1de5d)](https://preview.redd.it/6yv6ntj2mcl71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=90311fb91797b5ee8793a5f360b484aeb5d1de5d)

[Members of panel have considerable discretion over which companies to include in the most widely watched equity index](https://archive.is/NM9jr)

according to the Wall Street Journal (non-paywall, archived link).

From the article:

> Getting a stock into the most widely watched index isn't a straightforward or predictable process. Unlike indexes including the Russell 2000, whose makeup is primarily determined by criteria including market capitalization, the S&P 500 is constructed by a [committee of human beings](https://archive.is/o/NM9jr/https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-m-blitzer-stock-picker-behind-the-s-p-500-1495186202?mod=article_inline). The identities of the committee members, who are full-time staffers at S&P Dow Jones Indices, are kept anonymous."Entrance to the S&P 500 is a combination of both art and science," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.Committee members have a few rules they follow when deciding to make changes in the S&P 500. Companies being added to the index must be highly liquid U.S. firms with a market capitalization of at least $13.1 billion, for instance. Moreover, the committee has leeway in deciding on changes.The index committee has the final say on index constituents, which helps explain why the S&P 500 includes 500 of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies---but not necessarily the 500 largest companies.That means even companies that meet the requirements for inclusion don't necessarily have [a quick or easy ticket](https://archive.is/o/NM9jr/https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-addition-to-s-p-500-shows-why-indexes-are-so-weird-11606060800?mod=article_inline)into the index.At first glance, GameStop might seem to be a possible contender.The videogame retailer has been on a tear lately. Its shares are up more than 10-fold for the year, well above the S&P 500's 20% gain.The S&P 500 dropped GameStop from the index in 2016. In August this year, GameStop moved from the S&P 600 small-cap index to the S&P 400 midcap index.

So it's up to some crusty old Wall Street bankers and cronies? This should be interesting...

Quarterly Earnings Report via Conference Call- Sep. 8 @ 5:00 PM Eastern

Omg I made this meme 6 months ago.....😵🥴

Lots of anticipation over next week's QE report, which will take place once again via conference call, according to [Gamestop Investor Relations](https://investor.gamestop.com/home).

Anyone who remembers the QE report in the spring, it was jam packed and no one could get in, even the media. So expect this again. But this time we get to hear Matt Furlong (and maybe RC) speak instead of George Sherman, who sounded like he was reading a failing report card to his fucking parents.

Man I like this stock.

🦍 Jungle Updates🌴📰

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat- Week of 09-03-2021- Remember it's a 3 day Weekend for US Labor Day! 🍻](https://preview.redd.it/t1sf9f7cmcl71.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=e44882d1ce3f542770acce4d780869715d148dea)](https://preview.redd.it/t1sf9f7cmcl71.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=e44882d1ce3f542770acce4d780869715d148dea)

The Jungle Beat is back, but different

A daily update is a lot of work (and a lot of attention) and I feel like times have changed and especially in the current community, everyone is pretty zen. But it's still good to have an outlet for verified GME news and I think a weekend post is the perfect solution. Not to mention the sense of community in the comments can really make a difference in the HODLing experience. 💖

Every week the Jungle Beat will be posted after market closes on Friday and will stay pinned to the front of the sub through the weekend. I encourage you to not only use the comment space to leave remarks on the post itself, but to also utilize this space to discuss and fight the weekend FUD that can be overwhelming at times. Unless the FUD flavor of the week directly breaks rules, we like to leave it free for discussion and keep censorship to a minimum. So I think having a designated post through the weekend to discuss these things will help keep us on track to the moon. 💎🙌🚀

Fighting FUD with Facts

👉 Computershare- One major source of FUD for weeks now has been Computershare. Lots of speculation that this discussion is an elaborate FUD campaign with little merit or relevance. Well, I've been on a Computershare journey and[this most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/pficfa/computershare_megathread_part_2_withdrawing_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) will hopefully help put your mind at ease!

👉 Amazon and Jeff Bezos- Lots of chatter around possible ties between resident trash humans Jeff Bezos and Kenny Griffin. It reminds me of the ragnarock DD from long ago, tbh. This conversations seems relevant enough to GME to allow weekend discussion around it, so it's not really considered FUD at this time. We have to have room to explore relevant, legitimate "leads" if we expect to continue to grow wrinkles!

This screenshots lays it out pretty well (be advised you can't click those links, it's a screenshot lol)

[![r/GMEJungle - The Jungle Beat- Week of 09-03-2021- Remember it's a 3 day Weekend for US Labor Day! 🍻](https://preview.redd.it/inspz8vemcl71.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d45ad450824095da82e52bbac9a54bdb8ec6c96)](https://preview.redd.it/inspz8vemcl71.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d45ad450824095da82e52bbac9a54bdb8ec6c96)

Blockbuster, Sears and other Zombie Tickers

There has been noticeable correlation between some OTC shit penny stocks and GME and some wrinkly brains think it might be connected and somehow hiding short positions across the market. aka- A COMPLETELY FRAUDULENT SYSTEM (duh).

Having said that, any posts regarding those tickers and/or screenshots of purchases of those tickers breaks rules 1 and 5, so that's where we will draw the line and remove those posts. We want to harbor healthy discussion and debate, but this is still a GME sub at the end of the day and we don't want to confuse healthy discussion and DD with forum sliding.

Reddit Spam filters are in hyperdrive.

Comments and posts are getting removed with no explanation (including this very post.) Please be advised this is from higher up than this sub's mod team.

Other FUD topics may be added here through the weekend. Feel free to discuss in the comments! 👇

*You're strongly encouraged to remember the No Brigading rule*
