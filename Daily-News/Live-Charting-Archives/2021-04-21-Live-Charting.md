Hey guys I just randomly decided to do this as [u/WardenElite](https://www.reddit.com/u/WardenElite/) is taking a break, we'll see how it goes let me know if you like it and I can continue doing this while he is on hiatus.

I will delete previous images as the day progresses due to 20 image cap

Closed at 158.34 down 0.12% on the day. Narrating sideways chop on no volume has not been easy. Thank you guys all for tuning in I hope I didn't disappoint I had some big shoes to fill here today. Also, a huge thanks for the awards and positivity. A lot of people have been asking about streaming I am considering it here is my YouTube link for now <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmgi8psSbIWiSR2tefHbug> if you want. I will probably do this for a couple more days just to get a feel for it before I go live simultaneously. I think we may see a gap up in pre-market.

See you all tomorrow!

3:55 Edit 52

Look like we are gonna be closing at 158

3:51 Edit 51

So Close

3:36 Edit 50

GME and SPY running hot together interesting

3:22 Edit 49

Lost the battle for VWAP to the bears buy and sell volume are still crazy low let's see if we consolidate and push again

3:14 Edit 48

Broke out of the bear flag but volume is still awful this is probably our shot at ending up for the day

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/f9lefjyctku61.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=34faca1c82b66f553a72741c15df57412ec119a4)](https://preview.redd.it/f9lefjyctku61.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=34faca1c82b66f553a72741c15df57412ec119a4)

3:03 Edit 47

So unless we get some volume it looks like we will end the day somewhere in the 155-157 range

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/6shqsqjhrku61.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ab8944c640eef35044d156f410010a687b6537)](https://preview.redd.it/6shqsqjhrku61.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ab8944c640eef35044d156f410010a687b6537)

2:56 Edit 46

Volume coming in looks like we are gonna break that flag to the upside

2:45 Edit 45

Still trending downwards bear flags can keep traveling down till we settle at resistance. We still have no volume but power hour is coming up a decent push could set us up for a nice day tomorrow

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/juqv9uwrpku61.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce105c8ec2ce452d9f89373054dce09d4a97b0ce)](https://preview.redd.it/juqv9uwrpku61.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce105c8ec2ce452d9f89373054dce09d4a97b0ce)

Better picture for clarity

2:30 Edit 44

Looking for the bounce at 156.50

2:25 Edit 43

Trending downwards now nice bear flag forming, these tend to break up

New image for more clarity

2:20 Edit 42

Those rarely play out on the 1-minute , fortunately it looks like nobody is taking less than 157 for their shares, it also appears nobody want to buy GME for more than 157, at least right now

2:05 Edit 41

This is the cup let's see that handle

2:00 Edit 40

Just want break that sweet surface tension and get my tendies all gooey

1:52 Edit 39

How much can I talk about a stock that has 7 dollars of total range in a day?

Answer: A lot, I like this stock.

1:41 Edit 38

If this uptrend breaks expect them to push down pretty hard

1:37 Edit 37

You can see the bears really don't want us to break that resistance every time we move upward they are using more and more volume to keep the price down. It's ok they only have so much ammo.

1:31 Edit 36

Hopefully the breakout on this wedge puts the price above VWAP before power hour I know a lot of people with options expiring tomorrow wouldn't mind seeing a nice upswing today.

1:20 Edit 35

This could be the completion of that Head and Shoulders line at the bottom is resistance. Nobody is buying but apes sure as hell aren't selling

1:16 Edit 34

Breaking below on a little volume so we could see a dip to 156 or 152

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/3fi9yedc8ku61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=20592161c1150994db10c7709adfd3ddc8f675b3)](https://preview.redd.it/3fi9yedc8ku61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=20592161c1150994db10c7709adfd3ddc8f675b3)

1:00 Edit 33

We need a bit of volume on this bounce to crossover otherwise this is the new wedge I'm looking at

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/m78mntob5ku61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1beeafa056784684202ac3f25cb73e90c57938c)](https://preview.redd.it/m78mntob5ku61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1beeafa056784684202ac3f25cb73e90c57938c)

12:51 Edit 32

Possibly another dip buy, looks like a head and shoulders formed here

12:33 Edit 30

Even though the volume is low being above VWAP helps because the algorithmic /high frequency traders are more bullish above VWAP than below

12:30 Edit 29

Super technical breakdown of VWAP broke out the crayon for this

[![r/Superstonk - Live Charting with Pickle Financial for GME 4/21/21](https://preview.redd.it/qvbe88f10ku61.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=962457befb708f484c176d09c1bbededc519bb6a)](https://preview.redd.it/qvbe88f10ku61.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=962457befb708f484c176d09c1bbededc519bb6a)

12:26 Edit 28

If VWAP turns from resistance to support that positions GME well for a power hour test of the 175 resistance

12:21 Edit 27

This midday volume uptick is good news, testing VWAP now

Pushing for that VWAP crossover sell wall got dropped...and it's back

12:07 Edit 25

A little better volume on these last 2 candles triangle break out occurred earlier than I expected

12:05 Edit 24

Updated triangle with possible breakout point

12:00 Edit 23

The only real sell wall is at 162 and it is minimal any amount of decent upward volume should push us through that resistance at VWAP. That little short attack has pushed us under that previous resistance I posted earlier so I will re-draw momentarily

11:55 Edit 22

For those talking about negative beta it really doesn't effect anything the S&P is mooning right now and we are pretty stagnant

11:46 Edit 21

Small volume spike on that dip I figure they want us trading in that lower channel

11:38 Edit 20

We will probably see a nice dip buy opportunity coming up if you looking for a coupon

11:26 Edit 19

Looks like we need to consolidate more might break out around the x

11:24 Edit 18

Testing VWAP again

11:20 Edit 17

This stock wants to move up so badly even with no volume look at it fighting the good fight

11:12 Edit 16

*

11:05 Edit 15

I wouldn't say broke out, maybe rolled of the top, either way it will be hard to break that VWAP resistance without some volume

11:00 Edit 14

That spike earlier moved us $5 on 438,389 volume we probably would be trading in that lower channel without it. Also I am using Heikin Ashi Candlesticks I prefer them for day trading.

10:55 Edit 13

10:50 Edit 12

Just realized my new biggest fear; this thing taking off while I'm doing this

10:45 Edit 11

Look at me reading the tea leaves

10:36 Edit 10

It would be nice to cross vwap and trade in the upper channel

Nice little intraday wedge on the 1min chart for you guys! Slightly downward could break up

10:30 Edit 9

Feel free to shoot me questions in chat I'll try to get to them

10:27 Edit 8

Dogi--Up--Dogi--Down Low Volume is lame

10:19 Edit 7

These are the channels I expect we will trade in Today breaking through the upper purple line could be interesting

Purple (162.50) Green (160) Yelllow(156.50) Red (152)

10:10 Edit 6

Market is recovering from that brief correction yesterday, it's strength should help us a bit

10:05 Edit 5

Never used this before but it looks like some way OTM calls came in and a few deep ITM puts

Lottery tickets and hedges? I really don't wanna pay for premium lol.

9:58 Edit 4

Iborrow shows there were 40k at open 5k were used at opening bell to suppress spikes?

The buy-in we saw might be these 315,000 shares returned borrow rate is still up at 1.1%

9:51 Edit 3

I don't have options sonar so my analysis of the options chain may be a little weaker for the AM I'll sign up now, still very low volume. RSI got blown out a bit on the one minute probably settle between 158.5 and 162.5 for the time being

9:50 Edit 2

IV is low, fire sale!

9:43 Edit 1

We are quickly approaching that Pokeball day warden was speaking of but here comes that 9:50 dip on no volume. Probably more sideways chop till volume picks up
