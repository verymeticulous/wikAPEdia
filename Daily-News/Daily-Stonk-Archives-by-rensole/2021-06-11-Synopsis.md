Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

You get a reverse repo, you get one, everyone gets one!

Reverse repo's have hit a all time high again for the 5th day in a row?

I remember reading there was a 500 B maximum or 80 B per participant max, but then again what is 4 trillion split among friends right?

Also because there seems to be some misinformation regarding repo's lets check it real quick

*In a macro example of RRPs, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) uses repos and RRPs in order to provide stability in lending markets through open market operations (OMO). The RRP transaction is used* *less* *often than a repo by the Fed, as a repo puts money into the banking system when it is short, whereas an RRP borrows money from the system when there is too much liquidity. The Fed conducts RRPs in order to maintain long-term monetary policy and ensure capital liquidity levels in the market.*

A lot of people here seem to think that the fed is lending the hedgefunds money but this time its the other way around, the feds are the ones taking money and not lending it, but again seeing that it has a 0.0% award (no motivation for the others to participate) I believe they are "parking" money there because there is nothing out there that's a better spot.

Seeing a lot of people (like big brain Dr. Michael Burrrrrry) believe there is a huge market crash coming, it may be one of the better places to park your money because even if the rest of the market goes bust, the government (fed) will still have most of your money, so the reverse repo could in theory be used as a hedge against a market crash.

(or as I believe may be the problem, hedgefunds like Citadel going bust would cause a "contagion" effect once they go bust, resulting in an overall market crash)

New fair value for the stonk

Morning star has released their new "fair value" estimation for the stock.

it currently sits at 315.98 usd per share, meaning that by todays estimates of the stock (current price is 231.80) is heavily underpriced.

But that dip yesterday... hmmm gme said they may offer 5 million more shares right ? and the float was 70.7 million shares

Addendum:

it seems that the ortex data picture was debunked so I've removed it, as we can not confirm this is indeed a share offering or not (the filing is worded in a way that they reserve the right to do so and this is very normal for any annual meeting docs, then we don't know if and when they will be offered) so the next segment will be crossed out as I no longer believe these parts to be correct

~~Seems GME has added 3.57 million shares yesterday, meaning that today they can offer another 1.43 million shares, we get a massive dip and most likely see it rebound back to (at least) the minimum fair value.~~

And I'm currently still going through the filings from the annual shareholder meeting, but this would give them over a billion dollars extra bringing up their cash in hand to almost two billion usd. they could use that money for an extremely big variety of reasons, they can buy other companies, they can expand in certain areas they're not currently in or even pay for a special dividend

filing that seems to be connected to this: <https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312521186802/d34311dex51.htm>

One thing that I also believe that may be an option as of right now but is extremely tinfoilling hard.

Currently RC owns 12% and had a deal with the old board that he wouldn't buy more then 20%, perhaps with the new board in place his deal gets changed and he can buy more than the originally agreed 20%, or with the new share offering he can buy those and get up to the 20% mark and not be in breach of the contract.

Again that last part is pure speculation on my end and have nothing to back that up with.

our in house exponential floor guy [u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/) has been doing a chart for some time now and god damn it holds up...

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-11-2021](https://preview.redd.it/7blmqibrsl471.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2637348278dd874bea3a6dc114c6effdca595577)](https://preview.redd.it/7blmqibrsl471.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2637348278dd874bea3a6dc114c6effdca595577)

in his own words:

06/10 UPDATE: Broke the log-floor by ~1% ( ~5% in linear price scale ). I'd say that's within the reasonable margin of error for an equation I eyeballed ~4 weeks ago,

he originally made this weeks ago and posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ng2uzn/exponentially_increasing_floor_confirmed/) on how the floor is linear and exponential and other smart brain talk but, seeing he eyeballed this motherfucker 4 weeks in advance within a <1% margin of error... he may be the most wrinkly log ape we have here.

Melvin loses more paper... again

Remember until they close out their positions all these losses you hear about are losses on paper alone.

Looks like the SEC finally has a porn blocker

"At a Wall Street Journal conference earlier this week, Gensler said that the agency was looking at how an increasing proportion of trading occurs off exchanges, on platforms run by high-frequency traders." Now we know where Gary gets his DD: [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/)

Rememeber that 10Q filing ?

<https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18951/html>

> On May 26, 2021, we received a request from the Staff of the SEC for the voluntary production of documents and information concerning a SEC investigation into the trading activity in our securities and the securities of other companies. We are in the process of reviewing the request and producing the requested documents and intend to cooperate fully with the SEC Staff regarding this matter. This inquiry is not expected to adversely impact us.

And remember everyone the weekend is upon us, go outside have some fun, there is no need to fight the trolls/shills here in the weekend ;)

go and have some fun

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Edit 2:

Due to a mix up on my part earlier (i included an Ortex image which was debunked) there have been some posts about the amount of shares

> Edit: I want to be clear the dip can be both the ETF Shorting and a Gamestop Offering, but 🦍s wouldn't find out until well later during a quarterly report or announcement if Gamestop sells any shares.\
> From an 🦍, the increase is from shares for the CEO and CFO, Shares sold from the offering won't be shown if any have been sold , atm we only know of Kenny doing the dip via ETFs and Mayo.\
> Extra Data:\
> The 71.9 (estimation so 71.8) Million shares is also in Gamestops 2021 Financial News Release\
> "On April 26, 2021, the Company announced it raised approximately $551.7 million in net proceeds through the issuance of 3.5 million shares of common stock under its "at-the-market" equity offering program, resulting in total shares outstanding of approximately 71.9 million."

> The part about the offering seems wrong. I don't know how to raise awareness about this other than commenting. I wrote you a message fering. The shares outstanding was 74.2718 but they recently restricted 2.436M shares which I presume to be for the CEO, CFO and Board members.\
> Per Prospectus "The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering is based on 71,815,131 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 1, 2021, including 2,435,881 shares of restricted common stock which are subject to forfeiture or our right of repurchase as of such date."\
> "Common stock to be outstanding: Up to 76,815,131 shares (as more fully described in the notes following this table), assuming sales of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering."\
> Source: sec.report and my bloomberg terminal. We won't know once the ATM offering is complete until they file with the SEC

Thank you guys for giving feedback so fast and making sure we keep the info accurate

Team work makes the dream work! Thank you!
