DTCC Liquidity Test (again)

[So the DTCC is having a liquidity test this Thursday May 13th.](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf)

[What the hell is a liquidity test anyway?](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/Clearing-Services/FICC/CCLF-Annual-Test-Reference-Doc.pdf)

Well... This doesn't effect anything in the market in real time, it is merely a computer simulation test meant to test the liquidity of the market. But liquidity tests do require... liquidity. So you might need to sell a few things to rack up those liquid assets.....

Massive Sell of in DOW, NASDAQ, S&P 500, and C0ins

Maybe margin came calling and they're getting ready to cover? 🤷‍♀️

The SEC awards 2 new whistleblowers with rewards totaling $22 Million

[The first whistleblower received an award of $18 million, while the second whistleblower received a $4 million award.](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-81)  The larger award was in recognition of the fact that, among other things, the first whistleblower was the initial source of the investigation while the second whistleblower submitted information much later after the investigation was already underway.        

"This case demonstrates once again the value of the whistleblower program in helping to protect investors, and the Commission's continued commitment to rewarding individuals who provide high-quality tips," said Emily Pasquinelli, Acting Chief of the SEC's Office of the Whistleblower.  "The reporting of credible information by these whistleblowers and their subsequent cooperation with the staff's investigation allowed the Commission to better understand complex transactions related to the matters under investigation."

$18 MILLION IS A LOT OF FRICKIN DOUGH FOR WHISTLEBLOWING. THEY HAD CENTRAL INFO TO THE INVESTIGATION. THAT'S A BIG ASS RAT! 🐀

Bringing attention to the OBV once again - there has not been any significant selling since FEBRUARY. On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicates (in SPITE of the price action) that the trend has been on BUYING for the last 3 months. Good job, apes.

[DTCC RECEIVES SEC APPROVAL TO PROVIDE SECURITY-BASED SWAP DATA REPORTING SERVICES IN THE U.S.](https://www.dtcc.com/news/2021/may/10/dtcc-receives-sec-approval-to-provide-security-based-swap-data-reporting-services)

What the heck that means according to Dave Lauer, after a post claiming this would put an end to rehypothecation:

So unfortunately I don't think this is saying what you think it's saying. Now to be fair, I haven't had time to review in-depth. Couple of things:

1.  Any broker that facilitates trading already has to be registered, with FINRA.

2.  The Consolidated Audit Trail is the system that will be collecting trading data and will be used for forensic examinations for market manipulation. This system has been under development for almost 10 years, and is finally being rolled out, starting last year.

3.  This filing appears to be focused on security-based swaps, not the equities market. That's more focused on what happened with Archegos than what is happening with trading in the equities market. I don't believe anything here is directly related to the equities market, except insomuch as it's focused on security-based swaps. -[u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9abxf/i_dont_know_how_this_is_not_being_talked_about/gxmsr3h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

👀 New Mod-Only Post Flairs 👀

After an influx of requests for tighter moderation in the sub and much deliberation amongst the mod team, we decided it would be best to instead of removing questionable/unverified/contended posts, we would instead create some Mod-only use post flairs that we can assign when posts have been determined to be unverified, or totally debunked.

So we decided that removing some posts was too much, and instead made a mod-only flair

⚠Inconclusive⚠

so we can mark posts that seem suspect, inconclusive, or are potential FUD. OP can then revise their post with accurate info to have flair updated. Additionally, you apes can still see the post, and it's very transparent in what we are considering to be suspicious or potential FUD without removing it. You can then discuss for or against a flair change in the comments;

We also added the

🚨Debunked🚨

flair to the mod-only flair lineup. Please note, we will still remove posts that blatantly break rules; but this way we can manage in a transparent way whether to be cautious or not with posts.

Stupid is as stupid does

On that note, I made an error in yesterday's post, [which I corrected as soon as I saw dave lauer's explanation on the matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9326x/sro_filings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). We are all human and we all make mistakes. I want to stress the fact that if OP gets marked with the inconclusive flair and they bring verifiable data to back it up, the flair can be changed by mods. And note that while not exclusive to DD and education posts, that's the majority of what we had in mind when creating these flairs.

We're all just a bunch of smooth brained apes tryin' to get a couple wrinkles here. ✌

Don't forget tomorrow's AMA with Carl Hagberg at 4pm Eastern on Superstonk Live YouTube Channel!

[There is still time to submit your questions!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n8qq8v/official_ama_carl_hagberg_retail_shareholder/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This is an AMA you do NOT want to miss!!

All this time since January, we have been searching for answers, slowly peeling away the shit onion to expose more shit layers when we read DD like House of Cards. Screaming into the void, wondering where tf the SEC is. Or the White House is. Why isn't anyone doing anything to make this right.

I know we don't talk dates or catalysts around here. But I need apes to understand how game changing it will be when everyone exercises their right to vote. And Carl is coming to help us understand that. The importance of this AMA cannot be overstated.

THIS IS HOW WE EXPOSE THE MARKET FUCKERY IN A WAY THEY CAN'T DENY!!

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily DD- Tuesday 05-11-2021](https://preview.redd.it/zct0m3zeaey61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a36138eaf109061f75e4c31c09c43591a0044c2)](https://preview.redd.it/zct0m3zeaey61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a36138eaf109061f75e4c31c09c43591a0044c2)

YOU CAN HAZ CAT

💎🙌🚀SHOW ME THE MEMES!! 👀

I want you to show me your best GME meme!!! The 3 most upvoted memes from international apes will be declared GOAT and will finally be able to fill the little spoon void that your spouse left when they found out about your GME yolo. I will ship it to ANYWHERE THE USPS SHIPS TO OUTSIDE THE USA!! Free of cost, no rules to enter, just show me your best, funniest, most classic memes about the GME saga!!

I don't care if they're video or image, just as long as they are OC and they don't break any sub rules.

This contest will run through Friday, May 14th at 3pm Eastern, at which time comments will be locked! Upvoting will continue through the weekend. Winners will be announced in the Superstonk Daily on Monday, May 17, 2021 and winners will be contacted via personal message for shipping information.

Again, there is no shipping cost or anything to the winners! And tbh, if I end up being able to order more that the 3 plushies, I will give more away to top winners, so stay tuned!!

I love this community of apes!! Y'all are like family and you all deserve a hug from a cute lil cat 😻🐈💖💖💖

*Plushies will not be shipped anywhere in the USA! The plushy is available online at* [*Gamestop.com*](https://gamestop.com/)

*to USApes.*

[LINK TO THE MEME CONTEST IS LIVE NOW!!!!! LET THE MEMES BEGIN!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n919hi/superstonk_daily_giveaway_meme_contest_limited/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Memes are not considered to be entered into the competition until they are posted in the giveaway thread (regardless of being posted on the main page.)

*Addressing some FUD I've seen: Obviously by participating in this contest, you are willing to give an address for the prize to be shipped. There are many ways to safely get a package without giving your address. But I can't even afford to go visit my family out of state, I promise I won't show up in Germany or some shit unless it's post MOASS and I'm tryna buy a castle. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀*

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
