Good Morning Apes,

I hope you have had a pleasant weekend and avoided the mild forum sliding, anti-forum sliding forum sliding posts and the normal weekend shenanigans.

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 07-26-2021](https://preview.redd.it/hvuvl1axqid71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=745518a61fa001cf307f02cac45c1d05bb3824dc)](https://preview.redd.it/hvuvl1axqid71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=745518a61fa001cf307f02cac45c1d05bb3824dc)

I will not continue the Daily Stonk next week

The news will be under this section and you can skip to the second part :)

As you might know, originally I had only planned on covering the Daily Stonk for the weekend last week after rensole quit but after seeing the mods needing to reorganize and for someone to cover the news I continued as I had the time because I was and am on vacation (at home) for 2 weeks with the idea that I was likely going to stop after going back to work (now next Monday) and looking at it realistically I will indeed not be able to continue covering the Daily Stonk as I work long and hard hours (10-hour factory workdays with ramped up production, so I would miss a whole section of news as a lot of it gets replaced every 10-12 hours).

That said I will continue until the weekend! (but not cover the weekend), now this raises some questions about the Daily Stonk.

Should we continue it?

Is there a want for it to continue? (I'd say yes as there are some 3k who regularly upvote (and leave a lot of encouragement) and knowing only about 1/10th upvote on the bigger subreddits IIRC that means there should be some 10-30k or more reading it)

If so who and how will it continue?

Should it be mods who does it, normal users or both? (I'd say both)

Should it be a one-man job or a group effort? (I and others would recommend a group effort as it can take a lot of time and effort to make the daily stonk, I'd say about 2-3 hours for a slow/normal day and something like 7-8 hours for a big day like last Friday, at least for a lurker like me)

And if a group effort how would the work be spilt up, should it be collaborative per post or 1 person cover 1 day?

I also believe The daily stonk should be posted on the same account to avoid confusion and avoid people having to follow multiple accounts and ideally posted by a mod.

I want you guys and the mods to think about this over the week and If it will continue, to organize it before the weekend as I will not take part in it and go back to mostly lurking.

And Thank You for your patience and understanding for the past and next week as it's been quite experimental and a spur-of-the-moment. Edit I will also not change the format as I do not feel the need nor time to do so as I will only do a few more Daily stonk that said if there will be someone taking over after me they are welcomed to change it as they feel is fitting.

Quite a few things, First the mod list will be rearranged so expect the mods to be removed and re-added to the list, The mods are looking into adding more mods as they are understaffed, The Automod ban on the term Infinity Pool has been revoked, They are working on trying to get crossposting back, at least on a limited bases, The awards contest have not been forgotten and it's still on they just need some time to sort it out, They are developing internal policies to avoid more mod drama And they want to "reiterate that attempting to circumvent Automod is a major violation of the rules."

[[Speculative] Piecing together the ITM CALLs and the OTM PUTs. Melvin was margin called on January 25th, so they swapped risk to Citadel.

Criand made a long as post looking at how melvin (might have) closed their short position by transferring it to Citadel and Citadel transferring puts to melvin he also theorises that Point72 are short GME at 350$ which would be why they haven't experienced large losses and why it's so aggressively guarded. He also wants to be clear that " This does not mean that there will be no squeeze" just that "Point72 are still short and Citadel is most likely holding the bag." The MOASS is still happening.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

Superstonk Nor Reddit Nor Retail Investors, in general, are in any way, form or shape related to the capitol riots or the people behind it. Any such notions are Slander and Defamation to Superstock, Reddit and Retail Investors and will be looked upon negatively and could be pressed in court!
