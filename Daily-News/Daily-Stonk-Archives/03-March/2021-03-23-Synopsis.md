Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Do you smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

None of this is financial advice.

WardenElite getting hate.

Ok so yesterday [u/wardenelite](https://www.reddit.com/u/wardenelite/) was kind enough to stream and explain a lot of stuff , but once he was asked about the probability of it reaching 100k or higher he he believes its more probable the closer we get to it . and because of that immediately people started popping off and saying both [u/heyitspixel](https://www.reddit.com/u/heyitspixel/) [u/wardenelite](https://www.reddit.com/u/wardenelite/) and I where compromised.

so thanks for that I guess?

edit: just check that thread I'm done discussing statistics.

Q4 Earnings report.

After today's close we will finally get the Q4 earnings report.

People do need to keep in mind this is the last 3 months of last year, this will not include this years numbers at all.

In the Q4 last year RC did publicly stated that he owned a stake in GME but keep in mind the "hype" surrounding GME only started at around the end of January, also he was appointed in Q1 2021.

Does this mean the earnings report will be bad? no but it is lagging behind for 3 months, so we wont see the affect of the "GME Movement" untill the Q1 earnings.

This isn't me trying to piss in your coffee this is being realistic, nothing more.

Now that being said:

So going off of these metrics we are currently sitting at 2.8 p/s, and it seems to be semi stable at this point, so this is kindof what I expect from the earnings call/ the meeting afterward ( 5pm EDT here: [GameStop Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1424794&tp_key=d5ec83cadf))

If you have been paying attention you might have seen some already positive articles saying the earnings will be great, this is another opportunity of for fud. and you may think... Rensole if it's positive why is it fud?

Because its something you'll see in polls is doing well, but suddenly it gets crashed and it's worse than before, the same goes the other way. this comes down to overperforming or underperforming. so don't worry if this is a catalyst it will happen. remember we don't do dates so nothing has changed.

With the meeting expect they'll announce anything, a partnership with new companies, appointing new members to the board, a roadmap of the company where it will go and how it will do so, etc etc.

Buy the dip, hold and go eat some tendies

Addendum: it seems GME has a Q4 that seems to be November-December-January, so this does change it a bit.

Transfering

I honestly thought everyone here would at minimum contact their own brokers before doing anything. seeing that most of you dont here is a rundown.

If you TRANSFER your stocks TO ANOTHER broker, until they HIT that broker you CANNOT trade them.

This is why you've seen Shills trolling about transferring from one broker to another.

Here is a voice call confirming this

Melvin is having some trouble.

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

Also because people kept asking for my BTC I've made one and put the thingy in my profile.

Also for the people complaining, I've been doing this fulltime for close to two months, I've taken a lot of my own free time and earned nothing because I've been putting all my time into this.

So before you start complaining realize that I'm doing this voluntarily, and it's costing me money daily, yet I am still doing it.

also The next guy threatening me, or harassing me or anyone else gets an instaban, I'm done taking shit for helping people out.

Edit 1:

Because I also get spammed about what DD do I believe is the one I like the most, it's this one

<https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/>

I believe this is the best thought out, best presented version of DD

Edit 2:

Because some people dont understand what Statistical probability is, GOOGLE!

I personally believe in the squeeze and I'm sure of what will happen, I know there will be a squeeze, be it FTD squeeze or moass.

I'm not saying 1k is the top at all I'm saying statistically speaking a price movement closer to the current price is more likely than a movement to 500x what it is, it has nothing to do with what I believe the max price will be it has to do with Statistical probability.

the chance of you getting 10 bucks from a friend is statistically higher than 11 bucks, as is 10 bucks more likely than a 100.

The more the number go's out the less statistical probability it has to happen from a pure mathematical standpoint.

Again Statistical analysis is just PART of everything there are hundreds of variables in this, and statistics wont be the only indicator, otherwise we'd know what the end price would be and we would have a hard price saying X will be the amount.

Seriously if you think this is me undermining any price you never had any form of statistics and I'd advise looking it up and seeing what statistical analysis is and how it works.

Edit 3:

Frank Hamlin Chief Customer Officer to step down.

We are seeing changes at the top folks, strap in

Edit 4:

New Rules set for publication 3/24

[u/ReBjorn65](https://www.reddit.com/u/ReBjorn65/) just wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbgn48/nssc002_and_nssc801_update/)

I did not see a new post yet on this.

The rules for NSCC-002 and NSCC-801 that were filed by the SEC on 3/18 just got updated on the Federal Register this morning. They are set for publication tomorrow 3/24.

This will allow the DTCC to activate them. (From what I understand)

<https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an.htm> <https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/securities-and-exchange-commission> <https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings>

Edit 5:

Earnings are out =D

<https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-results>

Addendum:

George Sherman just basicly read the earnings, did not offer a future roadmap, did not offer any form of leadership on how they're shifting the company to be an Omnichannel company.

What he did underplay was the hiring of Neda Pacifico, Kelli Durkin, Ryan Cohen and their expertise With Chewy and what these new hires can do. let's just say "current" Ceo does not know his crowd.

And also Jenna Owens,

Ms. Owens brings approximately two decades of technology, operations, fulfillment, and supply chain experience to GameStop. Most recently, she was Director and General Manager for Distribution and Multi-Channel Fulfillment at Amazon. She previously held senior operations roles at Google and Honeywell. At GameStop, Ms. Owens will be responsible for overseeing functions that include business intelligence, fulfillment, supply chain, and store operations.

Overall the earnings was quite neutral (not extremely good or bad imo), given the fact that a prognosis of the company's 2020 fiscal year was made in 2019, pre pandemic, and it still did well enough to not have a bad earnings report is impressive.

Also if people see the AH go crazy, take a look at the level 2 data, it's algo trading.

Also DFV did not sell a single thing, he's still in, I'm still in
