The weekend news so far will be under this :)

Alright, an irl thing has occurred (nothing bad just a lot of stuff to do) which means I won't have the time to take care of the Daily stonk and will probably have to put SuperStonk and GME a bit on the backburner (I will still be here lurking and looking at posts when I can and I fully believe in the MOASS), I tried my best to keep it going as I know a lot of you (and me) found it useful, I even tried to make a group to help and I think it was going well but none of us have the time to run it and I won't be able to contribute but oh well for something that was supposed to only be one post, 2 weeks is not bad.

Thank you all for your encouragements over the past 2 weeks it's meant a lot and I'm actually surprised at how little negativity there were, I mean I haven't even gotten 1 self-harm/suicide report or anything from Reddit or any negative/shill/fud dm's at all, I'm very impressed. (edit alright I got one self-harm/suicide report but only because the bots picked up that I mentioned it)

And thank you mods for all the hard work you put in and I know there is a lot of negativity at times but I really do believe most of it are just from the loud minority/cautious people who didn't realize how negative/demanding they were and trolls/shills, and considering how big Superstonk is, shill/troll attacks and everything else, you're doing a great job! and keep at it for as long as you're able.

And thank you [u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) for doing the daily news/stonk for so long and despite the negativity at times it was very much appreciated from me and the community. And I know I kind of stole/copied The Daily Stonk but I hope and think you understand it was done in good faith :)

If any of you want to give running/making the daily stonk/news yourself I'd recommend doing it as a group and [here is a post containing how to make The Daily Stonk that I made for running it as a group in discord based on how I made the Daily Stonk myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovpypd/how_to_create_the_daily_stonk/), it's a little bit "and and and" but I hope some of it could be useful if someone takes up the torch.

Note [u/ViviconsAdventures](https://www.reddit.com/u/ViviconsAdventures/) is one of the people I was working with and he might do a weakly recap/meme recap to some capacity (but probably not as extensive).

And with that said here is the main news that has happened over the weekend so far and I will keep updating the Daily Stonk with new posts over the day till I go to bed.

A few days ago 1m put options apeard in Bloomberg then they where replaced by 540K from credit suisse and now the credit suisse put options are gone. Again a bug or something else?

MommaP123 have made another post about Registering your shares in your name (Direct Registration System) which would prevent those shares to FTD and goes a little into how it works, do note that "Registered shares may be difficult to sell in a MOASS situation" but would be good for the infinity pool.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
