Good Morning Apes,

Today there were quite a few posts that I wasn't sure if they should be added in, sorry if I accidentally dismissed something important or newsworthy, I'd recommend that you take a look for yourself just to make sure.

New GameStop Newsletter

[GameStop's official twitter account, shared this link to a new newsletter. Check out the links in the menu of the page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/osazeu/gamestops_official_twitter_account_shared_this/) - [u/Ashage](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ashage/)

<https://newsletter.gamestop.com/>

GameStop has a new newsletter but there is a bit of a disagreement in the comments on whether this is a customer newsletter or an investor newsletter as all the menu items are for investor relations rather than customer stuff.

Tony Kim on LinkedIn essentially lays his take that the SR-NSCC_202-010 is to prevent SHF from mass selling-off shares to meet margin calls instead they will get a money loan and the DTCC holds the Shares, this is to help cushion a market crash and he lays out Occam's razor for the GameStop situation.

zedinstead has made another magazine with 20 page about apes our memes and theories.

I'm not really sure what this means but I'm putting it in to see if you can make sense of it.

[What does it mean when Wall Street firm tells staff "Everybody take the week off"; layoffs coming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/os2a5m/what_does_it_mean_when_wall_street_firm_tells/) - [u/appleflaxen](https://www.reddit.com/user/appleflaxen/)

Seems like their excuse for the week off is due to wanting to avoid burnout but we all know it's most likely a coming mass layoff. The firm is Aquiline Capital Partners. Edit apparently Aquiline have little to nothing to do with the stock market so ignore this one.

Housing market Inflation

[Inflation Alert! Sales of new single-family houses in June plunged by 6.6% from May, and by 32% from the peak in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 houses, the lowest June since 2018, according to the Census Bureau this morning. Median sales price $361,800, Avg. price $428,700](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/os6hwi/inflation_alert_sales_of_new_singlefamily_houses/)

More Inflation every day and it just won't stop.

Housing and stock bubble

[We are finally seeing news articles that report on what we've been hollering about all along. We're getting close, apes. I can feel it. politico.com/news/2...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/os3p7s/we_are_finally_seeing_news_articles_that_report/) - [u/ThePlumBum](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThePlumBum/)

politico has put out an article that "critics warn of housing, stock bubble".

[TODAY is the next T+21 date. It seems forgotten, as some Apes have speculated it is not a real thing because of June 24th. But whilst not perfect, since RC Ventures bought in last August, T+21 *has* delivered some strong price actions far more often than not... (Just a reminder, not a prediction!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/orvssm/today_is_the_next_t21_date_it_seems_forgotten_as/) - [u/Region-Formal](https://www.reddit.com/user/Region-Formal/)

As Region-Formal says T+21 is currently considered not to be factual but the fact remains that there has been action on most t+21 so far so we should look out for the next few days to see if there are any significant price action otherwise t+21 should probably be considered to be debunked.

Elliott wave guy

possibly6 believes we are set for a bull run but we are just gonna have to wait and see so expect nothing hope for everything.

MACD crossover time

[Since the beginning of 2021 , GameStop's daily MACD indicator has reversed into the Green only 3 times (4 if you count April, but we had our offering which very briefly suppressed the price) ..

MACD has crossed over this kind of ties into Elliott wave guy that it's another indicator for a bull run but as I said "we are just gonna have to wait and see so expect nothing hope for everything."

interiumray have made a post about hack prevention, Main things are turn on multifactor authentication, don't click random links, don't give out your info to anyone. Also remember to get a VPN and stay anonymous.

Yesterday I asked you guys to think about and decide If, who and how the Daily stonk should continue after I return to work but after reading the comments I realized that ofc nothing would happen if I just left it out in the air essentially causing a kind of bystander effect as asking no one in particular to take up responsibility will cause no one to actually take up responsibility so after all the comments about wanting the daily stonk to continue as a group effort which I recommended I have been working on creating a system for it and will ask for volunteers, it's not done yet so I will talk more about it tomorrow but I think it's looking good so far.

And just a friendly reminder that I'm not a mod as there has been a little bit of confusion about that as of late, although I appreciate the sentiment :)

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!

Remember none of this is financial advice.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Transferring troubles

[I think they can't locate my shares because I been trying to transfer my account for the last 4 months and they partially transferred my GME shares today after multiple attempts!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/os84cz/i_think_they_cant_locate_my_shares_because_i_been/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) - [u/Mammoth-Priority-516](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mammoth-Priority-516/)

It has been known that transferring has been strange for half a year now but many can still transfer and buy so I think this is more that brokers transfer systems are god awful rather than them being unable to locate shares, although I wouldn't be surprised if they have a hard time doing that as well.

Edit apparently Aquiline Capital Partners have little to nothing to do with the stock market so ignore that one.
