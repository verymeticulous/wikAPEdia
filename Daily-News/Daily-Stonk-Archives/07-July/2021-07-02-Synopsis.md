Gamestop changes logo

It seems that GME changed it's logo from white and red to just white.

[u/Schborti](https://www.reddit.com/u/Schborti/) even reached out to them and asked what it's about and got this reply

They even posted video proof that it was indeed from within the app and not just a photoshop.

Vlad the stock impaler is in trouble.

In the past week Robinghood has become a hot topic once again, having disclosed they have settled for 70 million usd for misleading customers in the past few years, but wait there's more!

<https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5p8z/feds-seized-robinhood-ceos-phone-in-gamestop-trading-halt-investigation>

In its filing, Robinhood states that the fallout from these restrictions still have the potential to be disastrous for the company. "We have become aware of approximately 50 putative class actions ... relating to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions. The complaints generally allege breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and other common law claims. Several complaints further allege federal securities claims, federal and state antitrust claims and certain state consumer protection claims based on similar factual allegations," the S-1 states.

The best part:

The company said that the incident was bad for the company and "resulted in negative media attention, customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory and U.S. Congressional inquiries and investigations, capital raising by us in order to lift the trading restrictions while remaining in compliance with our net capital and deposit requirements and reputational harm.

*We cannot assure that similar events will not occur in the future."*

If this last statement is not a sign to get out of Robbing the Hood, I don't know what would.

Seems that the The company also said it is under investigation by a series of regulators, state attorneys general, the SEC, and the U.S. Department of Justice in proceedings associated with the trading restrictions; the company said its CEO Vladimir Tenev has also had his cell phone seized by federal attorneys. 

Seems like Vladdy boy may be in trouble, and now that so many agencies are involved would also be the reason we have not yet heard anything about it, this could be them gearing up to use RICO or something else, once a taskforce is set up or a multi agency operation you wont hear anything happen until it's over, as talking about their actions could jeopardize the investigation.

And with their IPO documents more came out, like how Citadel owns 1/3rd of them.

It seems that the US president wants to crack down on Kenny boy and others like him.

Because it seems some banks have been doing some bad stuff over the past years

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

This is a live stream of $GME on Bookmap trading application that measures liquidity in the market. The green triangles (Calls) and red triangles (Puts) are live options trades with the contract size in the center. The bottom line indicator in green (HIRO Cumulative) is an accumulation of those options as a hedging pressure. An upward trend on the green line when it crosses the red is a (Bullish) signal as HFs have to short stock, buy futures, or use options to hedge the line to flatten out representing delta neutral. The green and red lines are live buy's and sells coming in between the candle sticks which allow us to see double bottoms or topping patterns. ​Lastly, you can see order book flow on the right when strong buying is coming in and volume at the top right and bottom of each candle.
