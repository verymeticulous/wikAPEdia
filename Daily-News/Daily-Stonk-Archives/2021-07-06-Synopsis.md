Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

seems like the weekend was a quiet one for change

Peek-a-boo! I see 103M hidden shorts

[u/WhatCanIMakeToday](https://www.reddit.com/u/WhatCanIMakeToday/) made a thead [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oenvoh/peekaboo_i_see_103m_hidden_shorts_part_deux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

His post goes into checking the married puts/calls action, worthless OTM married puts are to hide short interest and Deep ITM calls are to hide/reset FTD's and after Feb 1'st they went up quite a bit.

It's an interesting read and idea that they indeed try to hide their short position with deep itm/otm married puts and calls.

The apes of the group

[u/zedinstead](https://www.reddit.com/u/zedinstead/) made a list of all the apes and what they do in the sub, it's good to keep this aside just in case it ever becomes useful for you, it's ranging from dank memelords to people who post TA.

the list can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oek6xl/im_just_a_guy_that_likes_the_stock_and_likes_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

no one is quite sure what it means...

US stock falling down

<https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/goldman-sachs-predicts-us-shares-to-begin-falling-20210705-p586yf>

Now goldman is predicting that the us shares will fall soon, now isn't that a thing 🤔

But wait there is more.

Reuters is reporting that our current situation isn't unlike other situations we've had before, mainly the crashes, but this time it's worse.

<https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/chancellor-this-time-isnt-different-scarier-2021-06-03/>

(also this is written by Edward Chancellor not THE chancellor)

And the Zoltan also saying there is danger on the horizon

<https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisses-zoltan-warns-of-trouble-ahead-in-money-markets-11625391002>

Now if I were a wrinkled ape, I would think this spells out danger for the banks/stockmarket in the months to come. but I know I'm smoothbrained at best

RC's tweets are timed with ETF FTDs

[u/dentisttft](https://www.reddit.com/u/dentisttft/) also has a theory that he might need some more eyes on, because perhaps this one holds true, and we can fill in the blanks were needed, or it's false and we can see why.

Either way it's interesting as hell to think about and think that there may be something there

Technical TA math stuff

[u/MOSfriedeggs](https://www.reddit.com/u/MOSfriedeggs/) made a TA, which shows mostly bullish signals, and even something that's even more rare then we normally see in TA Historical Volatility Percentile signal was given off last month, meaning we could see some big rips in the coming weeks.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
