🚨 Breaking News 🚨[SEC has no objections to NSCC-801](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-801)

All we are waiting for now is NSCC-002, which should go into effect no later than 5/8 (5/7 because of the weekend).

What does that mean?

It means theoretically 002 could go into effect as soon as today, but I wouldn't plan on it.

But soon moon 🚀🚀🌝

📢More on today's Big Wrinkly Brain AMA with Dave Lauer and [u/Jsmar18](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jsmar18/), intro by [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)

Here we go Apes... It's time for some big-brained learning

[![r/Superstonk - AMA DAY!! Wednesday Superstonk Daily DD 05-05-2021 Happy Cinco De Mayo to all our Mexican and Latin American Apes! 💚🤍❤](https://preview.redd.it/fbib424lf8x61.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=db2c89c91134dd77319a1d58d3cdaf57c1486a15)](https://preview.redd.it/fbib424lf8x61.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=db2c89c91134dd77319a1d58d3cdaf57c1486a15)

Big brain time 🧠

If you don't already know, we have a very exciting guest with us today, [David Lauer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itxbyXO67XY) is joining us for our second edition of [r/SuperStonk Live](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA). If you aren't familiar with David Lauer here is a quick rundown:

David Lauer used to build the very High-Frequency Trading systems used everywhere in the markets today. If anyone knows the ins and outs of these low latency trading systems, it's this guy. Following his time building these systems he went on to be the one to operate them.

Lauer took on the role of High-Frequency Trader at none other than Citadel. (Obviously, he will not be on to talk about any sensitive information, please keep that in mind). Following his tenure with Citadel, he went on to another company, Allston Trading where he also worked as a High-Frequency Trader. So there is no question that his experience in this field will provide us with some very valuable insight. After a bit more than a year of High-Frequency Trading, Lauer had the life-changing realization that HFT systems do more harm than good to our capital markets.

Since then, he has worked tirelessly to help improve the situation, even testifying before the US Senate. So, if there was any doubt, this guy is on the same side as us. That is to say, we share a common goal, improvement in the quality of our markets. David Lauer currently has a seat on the FINRA Market Regulation Committee and on the founding editorial board of the Journal of AI and Ethics.

So, now that you are caught up... ARE YOU AS HYPED AS I AM?! We are going to earn so many real wrinkles today, my fellow apes, The only thing the hedgies hate more than us buying and holding, is us Buying, Holding, and Learning. No more can they call us "Dumb Money".

So, without further delay, [Here is the link to the AMA](https://youtu.be/AYct0XX0uTU)!!!

It starts at 3:00 pm eastern time, just like the last one. So set your alarms folks. Also, Pink had the genius idea to include a timezone converter last time so here is [that](https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/) because timezones are confusing 😵😵

Back to you, [u/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsOnAcid/)! 🦄🐱‍🚀

Heckin low volume yesterday

If liquidity isn't an issue, then why was volume as low as the 100s yesterday? (Yes, 3 digits) [Some level 2 data even showing 1 min candles with literally 0 volume.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4t1mb/we_just_had_two_1_min_candles_with_0_volume_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I saw it said that it's like waiting for the last few kernels of popcorn to pop before enjoying your snack. 🍿 Everyone knows people around the world are buying and not selling because Gamestop is an awesome company with a bright future. Man I love this stock!!! 💎💅🚀🐱‍🚀

🚨 BANK OF AMERICA HEDGE FUND SELLING AT EXTREME LEVELS 🚨 This is not a drill!! Main Stream Media is reporting!

Why collect so much cash, BofA? Is for me? 👉👈

Don't get too excited about all the sudden influx of cash though. It's probably headed to [the Cayman Islands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4sbhz/omg_wtf_did_shitadel_register_something_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or [tied up in a divorce.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n487aq/in_relation_to_bill_gates_getting_divorced/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 🤷‍♀️ (<<<Total speculation)

Basically Bank of America Hedge Fund liquidated everything in their holdings that wasn't Real Estate or Health Care.

[Here is a free Bloomberg article that (kinda) explains](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/stock-winners-fall-in-latest-selloff-sparked-by-inflation-fears).

What does this have to do with GME? Ooooh IDK...

Maybe because BofA Securities is one of the clearing brokers for Citadel

New high score, anyone?

It appears the NASDAQ is upgrading (to accommodate more zeroes presumably [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅] ) and should be done by the end of the month.

Good Vibes from Pink Cat ☮✌💖🚀🌝🐈

I really do love each and every one of you apes. I want you to take care of yourselves on this trip in our favorite rocketship. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.🐱‍🚀

Don't gamble more than you can afford to lose. Make sure GME isn't your life plan. Eat as healthy as you can afford. Drink lots of water. Get a little sunshine every day. Hug your family, your pets, or your GME extra tight every day. And make love, not war. ✌💖🦄🐈

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
