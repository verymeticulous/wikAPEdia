That'll do!

Here's [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)**'s take on Gary Gensler:**

While some found yesterdays hearing to be, less than productive. I found it to be incredibly tit-jacking. For the first time, we got to see our boy Gary "The GameStopper" Gensler (as I like to call him) in action...

After all of the rumors that Gary Gensler was gonna' be our guy, I was pleased with with the sentiment he seemed to convey. I really got the feeling that we share similar interests in this.

These were my top three GG moments:

1.[This next one completely destroys all arguments that this subreddit or the language we use (such as We or Us) is "Market Manipulation" So that FUD is now dead (1:14)](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4448)

2.[Gary Gensler says that The Sec has a responsibility to protect us from shills. Also, here he insinuates that that all we are doing here is exercising our free speech (1:18)](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4717)

3\. [Gensler touching on Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) and how it can end up being opposed to the retail investors best interests](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4382) (1:13)

Honorable mention: [The submitted written testimony is definitely worth a read](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-20210505?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)!

GG's got our back

I am extremely excited to hear more about this "meme stocks report" that the SEC is going to put out "in the summer", that is where the really juicy stuff is going to come from the SEC...

Till then we continue to HODL, waiting for the slow-moving bureaucracy to catch-up. I will highlight something Dave Lauer said in his AMA to remind us that the SEC is going to help and is our friend here:

*"They don't move quickly, if there's anything that I can tell you-- It doesn't mean that they're being incompetent, or deliberately dragging their feet. They're a government regulator and they move extremely slowly ." -* [u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/)

These things take time. I am impatient though, so I am going to keep buying more while we have to wait.

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE🚨

Back to you, [u/PinkCatsonAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsonAcid/)! 🦄🐈💎🚀

Worth repeating: Control numbers, voting, and Carl Hagberg!!!

*This is a copy paste of the "Rock the Vote" post.*

The focus of the sub from now until June 9 is going to be *VOTING*

We don't make claims about catalysts around here. So I'm definitely NOT telling you that this could be the catalyst.

But the importance of exercising your right to vote cannot be understated. THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT TO PROVE TO THE SEC AND EVERYONE ELSE WHAT IS HAPPENING. GAMESTOP NEEDS OUR HELP!!

Fidelity users, TDA, WeBull, Vanguard, Schwab, and more all reported being able to get their hands on their control number and vote as of yesterday. Feel free to drop a comment below if you have already voted and want to show that off!! WE ARE GIVING AWAY VOTED STICKERS (FLAIRS) TO EVERYONE THAT HAS VOTED!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Be sure to check your inbox and contact your broker if you have any questions. And also be sure that if you have multiple brokerages accounts, you will need to get a different control number for each one. So if you carry shares in 3 different brokerage accounts (I do, cuz I don't trust a bitch) then you will have 3 different control numbers and will be voting 3 different times.

Steps to Voting:

1.  HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER

Obtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.

2\. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).

Do not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.

3\. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.

Take a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.

4\. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.

5\. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.

Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.

_________________________________________________________________________________

🐈 BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! 🦧

Well, did you...

-   Check your broker inbox for proxy info✔

-   Check your email✔

-   Send a message via your broker help/chat interface✔

-   Call your broker and request your control number✔

-   Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search✔

-   Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info✔

Keep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to a week or longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. 🤔

I can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website. I don't know what that means. I am still investigating why brokers seems to have their own landing page for proxy voting. Idk am not computer nerd, am just pink cat 🤷‍♀️ I can't wait to see what Carl has to say about that!!!!

Oh Lawd they Votin

As with anything, nothing changes if you don't VOTE!! 💪

📣📣Speaking of the importance of Proxy voting...📣📣

Do you apes wish you knew why we keep talking about voting being the most important play right now?!

Do you wish you could ask someone what proxy voting is?!

DO YOU WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST COME AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE HELL ALL THIS MEANS?! Yes please dear God

You really loved having Queen Kong, Dr. T on our Superstonk Live YouTube. Now it's time for you to meet [~~your Swedish Grandpa~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/kkc6k5/my_swedish_grandpa_tried_lingonberry_g_fuel_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Retail Shareholder Rights Expert, Mr. [Carl Hagberg](https://optimizeronline.com/about/)

OG Carl

*"Mr. Hagberg is considered to be one of the nation's leading experts on individual stock ownership programs. He has helped over 100 companies (including companies and government agencies in several Eastern European and Central Asian countries) to launch, improve or remarket programs aimed at customers, employees, existing stockholders and other affinity groups.* *He is also considered to be a leading expert on the proxy voting process and has served as Independent Inspector of Election, both in contested and uncontested situations, at over 300 annual and special meetings of shareholders."*

Just like Dr. T and many of the others I first learned about, I first saw Carl while watching the MANDATORY DOCUMENTARY FOR ALL APES, [The Wall Street Conspiracy](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU)

. This documentary first made its rounds in the subs in early February during the bleeding red days, and it really helped me gain some perspective. I'm serious I will give you a 💩 flair if you don't watch this documentary. Watch it and learn of the apes that came before us.

[Upon Dr. T's recommendation, everyone needs to read this comment from Mr. Hagberg to the SEC regarding overvoting!🚨](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-725/4725-4611649-176367.pdf)

We are honored and thrilled to have Mr. Hagberg in time to discuss these issues before the annual meeting on 6/9 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

📢This GAME CHANGING AMA with Carl will be Wednesday, 05-12-2021 at 4pm Eastern. Details to come! 📢

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

A note after speaking with [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/)

As you all know, Atobitt is going to be our host for this GAME CHANGING AMA 💯

He spoke with our guest on the phone earlier today to do a bit of a walk through before show time next week. He came back so excited he could hardly get a word in. He wanted me to express the urgency and attention we need to pay Carl and what he will be telling us.

After speaking with Carl, Ato had this to say "I'm literally not worried about any of this anymore, I am now Zen". THIS IS HUGE!

JUST LIKE WITH DR. T... IF [u/ATOBITT](https://www.reddit.com/u/ATOBITT/) THINKS THIS IS A GAME CHANGER, THEN I AM JACKED TO THE TITS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Change is coming

Good Vibes from Pink Cat ☮✌💖🚀🌝🐈

You heard Gary Gensler's statement about social media (dat us). He actually *confirmed* the fact that there are bad actors present online trying to sway public sentiment. FUD and shills are a real thing. The American government is acknowledging it. There wouldn't be so much attack 24/7 if we weren't on the verge of something incredible. So I urge you to always ignore (but report) the FUD and the attacks. And continue to live by the Ape's Creed of being excellent, and ape no fight ape. Remember the squeeze will not make us better people. That starts now.

WE HAVE BEEN LEGITIMIZED ON RECORD, IN 1 OF THE HIGHEST JURISDICTIONS OF THE WORLD-IN OUR STRUGGLE WITH FUD, AND IN OUR RIGHT TO GATHER HERE AND DISCUSS FREELY AS A GROUP. PLEASE TAKE SOLACE IN THAT.

THE LAST 5 MONTHS HAVE BEEN LEGITIMIZED.

Like Dr. Burry said- I may be early, but I'm not wrong.

Hopefully by now we all realize that we are in charge of defending this golden think tank that has been likened to the city of Athens. We are fostering and nurturing knowledge and growth that is going to *change the trajection of human history*. Look at the caliber of people that are coming to speak to us in our AMAs and helping us address the issues of fraud in our economic marketplace and naked short selling. Do you think all of this progress would be happening if we were crazy? Especially happening this quickly? We did sign up for a rocket trip, after all. 🐱‍🚀🐱‍🚀🐱‍🚀

Don't gamble more than you can afford to lose. Make sure GME isn't your life plan. Eat as healthy as you can afford. Drink lots of water. Get a little sunshine every day. Hug your family, your pets, and your GME extra tight every day. And make love, not war. ✌💖🦄🐈

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
