[Possible DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Possible%20DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

TL;DR: DTCC & Wall St want key things in place before GME unwinds:

1 - Rules of Engagement

2 - Funding

3 - Cover Story for Timing

4 - Avoiding Perception of Responsibility

Official notice that this is not financial advice, etc etc. I have no idea if any of this is indeed why these things are happening, or if they are even what I think they are. I bought a handful of shares before DFV's Congressional hearing because something seemed fucky, and that was my first stock purchase EVER. If you make financial decisions off of this speculation, you probably do eat crayons like me. I am literally just some Ape on the internet mashing buttons and you're gonna have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you took this as advice and then spent your whole allowance already this week.

So this [last post](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9xed/why_were_still_trading_sideways_and_why_we_havent/) from [u/c-digs](https://www.reddit.com/u/c-digs/) is about as close as anyone has come to my personal theory that there is a literal checklist somewhere that is getting marked off before this is allowed to unravel. The DTCC and Wall St (and probably the SEC) definitely do not want this spring to unwind before they are ready, and certainly not in a way in which they don't feel they are in control. These players are Big Corporate dicks with Big Corporate mindsets, and its my bet that they don't do anything without a plan that at least addresses all eventualities.

However, as it is now probably alarmingly clear to them this isn't just gonna go away on its own (cue Apes waving from the windows of the rocket sitting on the launchpad), the DTCC and pals are now scrambling to get the last things in place before somebody trips over the cord to the shredder at 3am and lands on the launch button.

I think the list goes something like this, but am intending this to be a crowdsourced document because there is no way I can keep this all straight on my own, and the GME Investor community has done so so much great DD already. There is definitely more to add in terms of DTCC / OCC / NSCC / SEC rules, and please comment with additional items & sources and I'll try to keep up with editing them into the list. Compiling it here can probably help determine just how close GME probably is to liftoff. It feels like we aren't that far from it now.

1 - Rules of Engagement

Opinon - Status: No-Go for Launch\
DTCC would benefit most if new rules about payments in a member default situation are in effect prior to launch.

✅ = in effect now\
❌ = pending review / revision

To Cover DTCC's own ass

-   SR-DTC-2021-003: Obligation to Reconcile Activity on a Regular Basis\
    *The "You're gonna report your risk daily now, you little shits" Rule.*\
    Filed 2021-03-09, Effective 2021-03-16 ✅\
    [src](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/)

-   SR-DTC-2021-004: Amend the Recovery & Wind-down Plan\
    *The "We'll liquidate your asse(t)s if you default, then make your pals chip in, before we pay a dime ourselves" Rule.*\
    Also stipulates what the DTCC is willing to cover when reconciling, as in only shares on the books, and why you (yes you Ape) should have a cash account and not a margin account.\

-   SR-DTC-2021-005 *Removed by DTCC for Review*\
    *The "We're tagging the shares you lend out so you can't do it more than once" Rule.*\
    Filed 2021-04-01, Removed for further Review src-1 / Now Expected week of April 26th-30th src-2 ❌\

-   SR-DTC-2021-006: Remove the Security Holder Tracking Service\
    *The "We're dropping the old way of tracking shares, cause it didn't work well, and DTC-2021-005 will do it better" Rule.*\
    It was speculated in another post that the old system of tracking needed to be removed so there was no conflict in implementing DTC-2021-005 (I can't find that post here on reddit anymore, src needed!). It's likely that this could pave the way for 005 to be implemented. Filed 2021-04-22, Effective Immediately ✅\
    [src](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwhyhw/sec_files_srdtc2021006_removing_the_old_and/) <- also my post

-   SR-DTC-2021-007: Update the DTC Corporate Actions Distributions Service Guide\
    *The "Stop bickering back and forth over the manual adjustments to your peer to peer trade records via the dumb APO method, and just use the GD computer validated Claim Connect system, please" Rule.*\
    Way to make a super vague title DTC... This is mostly about borrowed shares and updating who pays how much when circumstances - like rates - change. The old system (APO) needed both parties to just agree on the adjustments and one side could only submit an adjustment at a time, so it was rarely agreed upon in one pass and the bad guys could likely stall with many back and forths. To me this reads as a please use this better thing now, because APO will go away on July 9th 2021 so you'll have to use Claim Connect by then anyways. Since the lender is likely incentivized to use the new system, it may get adopted in higher numbers sooner.\

Non-regulation / Other Announcments

GOV-1085-21: DTCC / FICC White Paper Announcing WABR added as a Sponsored Member\
WABR Cayman Limited is a firm specializing in helping Institutional Sales Traders in times of "thin markets". [u/stellarEVH](https://www.reddit.com/u/stellarEVH/) explains:\
*"When a company needs to quickly pay off their debts as in the case of a margin call, it can be challenging for them to gather all the money from their various investments. There are firms in place that are specialized in liquidating their portfolio in a manner to minimize market impact while they pay off their debt."*\

MBS978-21: FICC Notice on MBSD Intraday Mark-to-Market Charge - Timing of Intraday Collection\
*We've been lenient for the past year cause shit was wack, but we're going back on that regular hourly assesment for margins.* "Starting on May 3, 2021, the fixed time of 1:00PM will be eliminated and the MBSD Intraday Mark-to-Market Charge will return to an hourly assessment." This combined with other things will tighten the screws.\
[/u/stellarEVH](https://www.reddit.com/u/stellarEVH/) bringing that good good again: *"For example, it'll be much harder to short GameStop and/or trade in dark pools when you're expected to cover your margin every hour. For the last year, they've only needed to prove they were covered at 1pm."*\

2 - Funding

Opinion - Status: Go for Launch\
SR-DTC-2021-004 was likely the big one here, but SR-OCC-2021-004 would be very handy in the aftermath so it's maybe 70/30 in my eyes.

3 - Cover for Timing of Launch

Opinion - Status: No-Go for Launch\
This will likely be the very last one, and we'll only know what they will use as an excuse once it's started. I think all the other pieces would need to be in place for them to feel most confident to light the fuse. This will be more oportunistic in nature, I think.

Ideally a plausible Corporate or Market Event that the stock price "should" respond to in order to initiate without the timing looking SUS AF and destabilizing broader market due to fear systemic problems.

-   *(other suggestions wanted)*

4 - Fallguy, and the Lack of Prevention

Opinion - Status: Go for Launch\
While they will likely have a fallguy decided upon prior to launch, I don't see it as a necessity that would delay it, certainly not like the Rules of Engagement or Funding would. I also think that nothing would keep them from changing the story if something else influences the narrative in an acceptable way shortly after liftoff.

Blame!

After the market pain is significant enough that the public wants answers, why not lay all the blame on bad actors, and defer attention from the system to try to avoid additional exterior regulation.

Edit 6 on 2021-04-22:\

Looks like more preparing for catastrophe.

Edit 7 on 2021-04-22:\
Added SR-DTC-2021-006 effective immediately (April 22nd), which ends the old security holder tracking service, possibly making way for DTC-2021-005 which is the new tagging system for loaned shares.

Updated expected date on SR-DTC-2021-005 refiling and sources, added DTCC planned stress test for 2021-04-26, notes on expected dates of other pending rules, MY OPINION on each category's status for launch, other link for sources.

Updates NSCC-2021-801 as in the clear in Section 1. Added DTCC's T+1 Settlement Plan announcement about kind of having a plan soon in Section 4.

NSCC-2021-002 officially delayed as far as June 21, 2021. Sunshine meeting for today postponed again.
