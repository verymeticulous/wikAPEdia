Any wrinkle brains know anything about this? Just got updated.

*The Minimum Required Fund Deposit As part of its market risk management strategy, NSCC manages its credit exposure to Members by determining the appropriate Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund and monitoring its sufficiency, as provided for in the Rules.4 The Required Fund Deposit serves as each Member's margin. The objective of a Member's Required Fund Deposit is to mitigate potential losses to NSCC associated with liquidation of the Member's portfolio in the event NSCC ceases to act for that Member (hereinafter referred to as a "default").5 The aggregate of all Members' Required Fund Deposits, together with certain other deposits required under the Rules, constitutes the Clearing Fund of NSCC, which it would access, among other instances, should a defaulting Member's own Required Fund Deposit be insufficient to satisfy losses to NSCC caused by the liquidation of that Member's portfolio. Pursuant to the Rules, each Member's Required Fund Deposit amount consists of a number of applicable components, each of which is calculated to address specific risks faced by NSCC, as identified within Procedure XV.6 Currently, each Member is required to maintain a minimum Required Fund Deposit amount of $10,000.7 If a Member's Required Fund Deposit, as calculated by Procedure XV, is less than $10,000 on a given day, NSCC requires a deposit to bring the Member's Required Fund Deposit up to $10,000. The first 40% of a Member's Required Fund Deposit, but no less than the minimum Required Fund Deposit amount of $10,000, is required to be in cash.8 NSCC's margining methodologies are designed to mitigate market, liquidity and other risks. NSCC regularly assesses its margining methodologies to evaluate whether margin levels are commensurate with the particular risk attributes of each relevant product, portfolio, and market. In connection with such regular reviews, NSCC has determined that there are circumstances where the current minimum Required Fund Deposit amount is insufficient to manage NSCC's risk in the event of an abrupt or sudden increase in a Member's activity.*

## Relevant Comment by [u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/user/dlauer/)
Doesn't seem like such a big deal - they're increasing the minimum deposit from $10k to $250k. While that's a big increase, it probably doesn't impact large brokers, which is what would make an impact on the things everyone is concerned about here.
