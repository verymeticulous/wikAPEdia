We now need NSCC-002 to be approved for the changes to be implemented. The deadline is for an SEC response to NSCC-002 is 5/8, but effectively 5/7 because of the weekend.

Edit: It is worth reading Section III of the [SEC statement](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2021/34-91770.pdf). The SEC supports the change on many levels, which is good news for NSCC-002.
