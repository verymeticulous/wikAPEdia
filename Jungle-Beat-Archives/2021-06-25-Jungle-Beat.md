Russell 1000

Every year in May and June, the Russell Indexes release an updated list of the constituents for their various indexes, notably the Russell 2000 and Russell 1000.

And today $GME qualifies to be added to the Russell 1000 Index. Which historically is a day in the stock market that sees the most volume action.

I've seen a lot of discussion of whether this means that shorts will have to cover the ETFs they shorted that contained $GME. The answer, as far as I can tell, is no. Well.... not necessarily....

[u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/) clarified that in this comment:

"*There's not really any kind of short-covering requirement when a stock gets added to an index.* *However, the announcement is usually bullish because it adds buying pressure.* *Russell rebalancing day is the the CRAZIEST day in the stock market. Volatility and volume is usually the highest on that day, as stocks are added and removed from Russell indices, and weightings are changed. A bunch of ETFs follow Russell indices and need to rebalance their portfolios to reflect the new index composition in order to minimize tracking error. So getting added is a big deal, and leads to a lot of buying pressure from those ETFs (and from people trading ahead of that addition and trying to get the alpha between the announcement and rebalance dates).*"

Also remember that we are not likely to see the resulting action in the stock volume (or price) until afterhours or Monday/next week.

So don't get toooo hyped thinking that this will be some sort of catalyst by forcing shorts to cover. Yes, all shorts must cover eventually, but this is not that. Still cool af though!

[Just a Reminder that Moving to the Russell 1000 means selling. Expect some downward movement before upward movement this after noon.

Monkey Business

Yesterday [u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/) was an absolute pro at hosting another fun episode of Monkey Business on the Superstonk Live YouTube channel! We talked about RRPs, Ryan Cohen Tweets, Gamestop's ATM offering, and more. And right now I want to give an extra shout out and thank you to our guests!

A Note from your friendly local Pink Cat ✌❤🐈🦄🚀

I've seen lots of confusion on where to go if/when reddit goes down, which has been happening a lot more lately. While we do have an "emergency broadcast system" in place, I encourage you to remember, that pretty much everyone in Superstonk is a long term investor, and my personal mantra is just Buy and HODL. I love the company and will probably sit on my shares for far longer than Citadel is a standing business. I like the stock.

But I digress... no, we aren't meeting at Gangnam Style. Apparently that originated with the movie crowd and that's not our video to claim anyway. All the mods twitters are listed below, and the YouTube channel has a lot of content to hang out in the comments. Just wanted to clear up any confusion!
