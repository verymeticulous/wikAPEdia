$GME is Primed to Join the Russell 1000

So what is the Russell 1000 and why is this a huge deal for the future of GME?

[From investopedia:](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell_1000index.asp)

KEY TAKEAWAYS

-   The Russell 1000 Index represents the top 1000 companies by market capitalization in the United States.

-   The index is a subset of the Russell 3000 Index.

-   The Russell 1000 index comprises about 92% of the total market cap of all listed stocks in the U.S. equity market.

-   It is considered a bellwether index for large-cap investing.

-   Performance and characteristics of the index are provided monthly by FTSE Russell.

The official announcements will be made on June 28th. Until then, it's technically speculative based on qualifications. [But major news sources are reporting it already.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-amc-russell-1000-51623883459)

Also... "Liftoff"- JPow Makin it go Brrr Again (banks r fuk)

We covered it yesterday, but I've seen lots of conversation around yesterday's Fed press conference. And yes, JPow really said "Liftoff". Tbf, he's talking about inflation, I believe.

[Around the 23m mark is when he says "liftoff"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ0EQHxPZd8)

[This ape did a partial transcript of the Q&A portion of the Press Conference!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1do4y/transcript_of_jpow_press_conference_16_june_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

*So what does all this mean?*

...I NEED AN ADULT!

Basically, the Fed decided to increase the interest paid on their ~~junk~~ Treasury Bonds from 0% to 0.05%. So it's more profitable for big banks to park their overflowing cash with the Fed. *Basically, the banks have too much cash so the Fed is giving them more cash- taps brain.*

The idea here is that taking some of this money out of circulation of the banks will serve to DEFLATE some of the INFLATION concerns. We shall see. 🤷‍♀️

And on that note... we printed a correction yesterday regarding 005, saying that we were wrong, and 005 is not in effect yet.

That was bad information and it was like we originally thought... 005 is in effect, immediately upon filing.
