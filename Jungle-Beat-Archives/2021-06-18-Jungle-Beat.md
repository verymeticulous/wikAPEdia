What are Community Awards?

Regular "awards" are purchased with Coins, a mechanism of Reddit that ultimately requires real money to purchase packs of coins that can then be spent on awards for posts and comments. [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) does not receive any money when they are purchased, but it does receive Coins when users gift Community Awards.

> Community Awards are unique to each community, and members can give them to each other. Moderators can design and name the Awards however they want.A portion of Coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited to the community's Coin balance. Moderators can use Coins from that balance to reward members with Mod Awards. The Coin balance is shown only to moderators in the community's sidebar.

Moderators do NOT have access to the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) coin bank other than to give Community Awards on this sub to quality posts and comments. Moderators do NOT receive any coins personally, and only certain mods with permissions can access the coin bank for this purpose.

Community Award: Any user can gift this award for an amount of Coins (min. 500) to a post or comment. Each of these awards will also gift Coins to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) itself, allowing mods to give mod-exclusive awards. For example, a 500 Coin Community Award also gives the subreddit 100 Coins.

Mod-Exclusive Community Award: These awards are purchased using the Coins available only to mods from the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) Coin bank, and give a certain amount of Reddit Premium to the recipient. For example, a 1800 Coin Mod-Exclusive Community Award will grant one month of Reddit Premium.

*Reddit Premium gives 700 monthly coins, access to Premium Awards, and more. Learn about it here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium)

Currently, we have two Community Awards: the Superstonk Award (500 Coins, giftable by members), and the Not-A-Cat Golden Bananya Award (1800 Coins, giftable by mods only).

Ape Not Fight Ape, unless for top prize!

Award Contest

We ask you, [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) members and lurkers, to use your best design skills to create award icons that we can then place into the Community Awards. You will need to think of a great name, too, but note we must keep it (mostly) family friendly. We are limiting to one design/name per submission, so make it good!

The top eight designs will be made into the following awards:

-   5th-8th: Community Award (cost: 500 Coins, 100 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))

-   4th: Community Award (cost: 1000 Coins, 200 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))

-   3rd: Community Award (cost: 2000 Coins, 400 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))

-   2nd: Mod-Exclusive Award for 1-month Premium (mod cost: 1800 Coins)

-   1st: Mod-Exclusive Award for 3-month Premium (mod cost: 5400 Coins)

Additionally, 1st and 2nd place will receive FOUR of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive awards on their top posts and/or comments, 3rd and 4th place will receive ONE of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive award, and 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th place will each receive ONE of the new 1-month Premium mod-exclusive award. This will effectively win you Coins and Premium membership, as well as serious clout from designing an official sub award.

To submit, please follow the guidelines below.

It's Flair Friday, but Everyday is Kinda Flair Friday...

I started doing the Flair Friday thing with the daily posts back when I was filling in for the morning update and it was a fun way to connect with you guys since I don't get to hang out in the comments of my memes with you any more. It has grown to now becoming one of the most popular aspects of the Jungle Beat posts, which I love! I really enjoy coming up with mayonnaise-laden puns and emoji scrambles for each one of you, though I don't think I've ever gotten to the end of the comments list, even when I lock them. I do try to work on them in spare time but what is spare time anymore....

Please don't be discouraged or think I'm ignoring you if you have repeatedly asked and yet to receive your flair! I have been getting flair comments every day this week which I don't mind, as long as you all understand that I will get to as many as I can!! I love you all and don't want anyone to feel left out or overlooked! I WILL GET TO YOU I PROMISE, EACH ONE OF YOU IS AWESOME AND DESERVES A CUSTOM FLAIR!! 💖💖💖

Drop a comment with your desired flair!

A note from your friendly local Pink Cat ✌💖🐈

It's been a wild few weeks.. or, months.. (years? What decade is it?) This has been a crazy journey and I want to take a minute to check in with the group. Everybody has been go-go-going.

The media is everywhere (MSM for those wondering wtf that acronym means- Main Stream Media) and it seems that they are trying to paint a picture of collusion on the $GME stock and others (which they deem "meme" stocks which at this point is borderline weaponized against us but I digress) and I know there is a general air of concern around the entire community. I'm just reassuring you guys. This gal right here and the whole mod team, are making sure to keep the sub a very tightly run ship. No fuck-ups allowed. The hedgies and their bought MSM platforms are trying, desperately, to gain access to the fortress of our City of Athens, and the walls remain steadfast. This will not change for the foreseeable future.

I want everyone to seriously take a mental health break from all this whenever you can.

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat- Friday 06-18-2021 FLAIR FRIDAY 🦍🌴🥁🔥🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/556n4iyf23671.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dae16d0caf1068f5f8447c1c2b35e4d0cc37b196)](https://preview.redd.it/556n4iyf23671.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dae16d0caf1068f5f8447c1c2b35e4d0cc37b196)

me @ me rn

Drink plenty of water. Go for a walk. Go call an old friend, or your mom. Kiss your kids forehead and read them a book. Cook dinner with your spouse, meet up with online friends for a game, go for a drive.... just get your headspace out of Superstonk every once in a while and remember to take care of yourself physically and mentally. They don't call it a Long position for nothing ;)

I want to thank all of you apes for continuing to be awesome and excellent to each other and growing this community into the beautiful space it is today. You all deserve this seat here. I'm honored to be on this rocket ship with you all. 💖
