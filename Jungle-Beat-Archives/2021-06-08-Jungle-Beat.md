Annual Shareholder Meeting 6-9 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Alright apes! The time has come for Gamestop's Annual Shareholder Meeting! Remember in January when this seemed like a lifetime away? Now look at us. Look at us.

June me @ January me- LOOK AT US

I want us all to have realistic expectations for the meeting... and I want to make it perfectly clear that this meeting is not the place to gather and have Woodstonk. (I promise that's a coming major event after MOASS!) But it *is* kinda the center of our Superstonk universe for the time being, and the mods wanted to make sure to have coverage of the day's events, including the shareholder meeting from 11:00-11:15 am Eastern, and the QE Report later at 5:00 pm Eastern.

So, there will be live coverage on location at Gamestop Corporate Headquarters, as well as the premiere of our new community roundtable style livestream, Monkey Business!

At 4:30 pm Eastern, Monkey Business will be live on Superstonk Live YouTube! Hosted by [u/jsmar18](https://www.reddit.com/u/jsmar18/) and [u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/) and joined by apes from the Superstonk community, they are going to be discussing the meeting, the financial report, and whatever else happens that day! Stay tuned for more details!

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat-Tuesday 06-08-2021- HAPPY BIRTHDAY DFV!! VOTE YOUR SHARES!!](https://preview.redd.it/qqkwtxkw12471.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9540f14d0ed8633d3e97fdab8ed1e1f28081e4)](https://preview.redd.it/qqkwtxkw12471.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a9540f14d0ed8633d3e97fdab8ed1e1f28081e4)

And on that note... I want to make sure apes are very clear on some things. If you are an ape going to the meeting:

-   Be overly respectful of the space and people around you. Pretend you are at a job interview.

-   Don't leave any trash (Leave nothing but footprints.. take nothing but pictures!)

-   Don't be a disturbance to the peace i.e. no loud music, yelling, fighting, or anything else that would make corporate want to call the local police.

-   If you gather in any capacity, even to sing songs, gather peacefully.

-   Distance yourselves from any bad actors or those seemingly trying to make a scene. Publicly denouncing the shill bad actors will help pluck them out of a crowd very quickly.

-   Remember the world, the media, even Ryan Cohen and DFV themselves, will be watching and judging apes behavior that day. Be a good example!

-   Most importantly, HAVE FUN!!! 🤙✌💖🚀

Mod Hiatus Update

*by* [u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/)

Modding Superstonk is a 25/8 job (best job everrrr!). And as we grow, the need for all hands on deck grows larger by the day. And as more mods take hiatus, the need for a plan in place becomes more apparent to keep the ball rolling smoothly. The mod team has discussed how to address the issue of how to approach a hiatus, and believe we have come up with a solution.

Communication rules and parameters have been put in place with majority votes from the entire mod team supporting the new rules. Basically, if we haven't heard from a mod for a number of weeks, then permissions will increasingly be removed, ultimately leading to a team vote on the moderator's position being frozen indefinitely. These rules were also voted to be applied retroactively, and have resulted in Administrative action.

Therefore, please be advised of the following:

[u/StonkU2](https://www.reddit.com/u/StonkU2/) and [u/heyitspixel](https://www.reddit.com/u/heyitspixel/) have been placed in what we have deemed "hiatus mode" for individual reasons, though the result is the same. They no longer have access to any moderator capabilities and now hold the same permissions as a regular user. As such, please be aware that they are no longer representatives of the Superstonk mod team *at this time* and any communication from them is coming as an individual. We have not been able to make or keep contact per the guidelines set forth, therefore their moderator permissions have been removed, and further action will be brought to a vote within in the mod team in the coming days (their moderator position has not been revoked in any way, only their permissions). Transparency will of course be maintained as changes are made in the best interest of Superstonk. 💪

Deep Fucking Birthday Wishes 🥳🎊🎉

*by* [u/bradduck_flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/bradduck_flyntmoore/)

Howdy apes! [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) here! As many of you know, today is the birthday of the now-famous retail investor, DFV.

[![r/Superstonk - The Jungle Beat-Tuesday 06-08-2021- HAPPY BIRTHDAY DFV!! VOTE YOUR SHARES!!](https://preview.redd.it/z5wk4095b2471.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=82e72b166e54b32bb78ec1696c7a0ae252044815)](https://preview.redd.it/z5wk4095b2471.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=82e72b166e54b32bb78ec1696c7a0ae252044815)

Like so many of you, this Ape-Bassador first heard about GME through him, and it has been a WILD ride ever since. There have been a lot of rumblings about the need for a "birthday card" post of sorts, so all the Deep Fucking Birthday Wishes can be expressed in a single place. Mods agree! This will help keep the sub from sliding otherwise worthwhile content AND make it easier for DFV (we know you lurk here) to see all the nice things we have to say in one spot.

That means two things, apes: 1) Today's special edition of The Jungle Beat will serve as the Official Superstonk Birthday Card to DFV, please put all your wishes to him in the comments; and 2) we gonna delete all the rest. Please report any DFV birthday posts outside of the official birthday card so mods can remove it. As much as I respect and appreciate him for introducing me to GameStop, this sub is about GME, not DFV. Thanks in advance to all apes for your understanding and cooperation.

Make sure to check back at tomorrow's Jungle Beat for info on Mod plans for the Annual Shareholder Meeting. Until then, and as always, Buy, Hodl, Vote if you can, and always be excellent to each other.

ShareHOLDers Meeting

by [u/bradduck_flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/bradduck_flyntmoore/)

Howdy apes! [u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/) here! I come to you today with news of our plans for the 6/9 GameStop Annual Shareholder meeting for 2021. Yes, after all this time, it is happening tomorrow! Many of you are already aware that your Ape-bassador recruited a bunch of volunteers who were planning on being at the meeting in person. To that end, we have coordinated with [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/) to bring you all a live stream of the events!

The stream will be viewable on the never-monetized Superstonk YouTube channel and will begin at 10am ET. The feed will be switched between the various volunteers until the meeting starts. Since we do not know if any recording will be allowed inside, there is the possibility we will switch from our stream to theirs when the meeting gets underway at 11pm ET. The meeting is scheduled to last for 15 whole minutes, so do not be surprised if nothing too juicy comes out of it. Then again, maybe we will finally get to hear about the plans for GameStop's future! Nobody knows for sure, but we will do our best to bring you the info live. Our live stream will resume once the meeting commences, assuming we had to cut away in the first place.

We have already gone over expectations with the volunteers, but for those of you who will be there that are not presently aware: BEHAVE. The shareholder meeting is a thing of business and should be treated as such. Honestly, I'm not too concerned about legit Superstonk peeps, rather, any instigators that may attempt to wear the Superstonk mantle for the purposes of bringing shame upon the name. Shun them, disregard them, and point out non-apely behaviour. Kindness, patience, and knowledge are our weapons, and we utilize them well.

Once we wrap up, the volunteers will be going through their pics and vids and submitting the best captures to the mod team. So any ape that is interested in using some of the footage we collect for the purposes of hype-vids, just let me know and I'll get you on the list. There should be plenty for several unique videos, even if we get a lot of requests for the footage, so don't be shy.

Before I sign off, I'd like to point out that the vote total will almost definitely not be shared at the meeting. Typically, the results are released 3-5 days after the fact, as [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/) has mentioned on other threads. Do not be surprised if we see some fuckery with the price over the next several days, as that seems to be the go-to hedgie tactic any time GameStop has a meeting of any kind. Until tomorrow, buy, hold, vote if you can, and always be excellent to each other.

Power to the Player!

Ghost in the Shill

*written by SATORI co-creator* [u/catto_del_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/)

[Oh yeah, it's all coming together](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqnora/satori_the_first_36_hours/). The mod team and SATORI squad have received a fantastic amount of love, support and gratitude for sweeping up the shills, fixing ModMail, providing valuable insights and otherwise doing our part to keep Superstonk as wonderful as ever. Fan mail, fan art, even a [serenade to our beloved algo-rilla.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgu4e/i_sing_satori_a_song/)

The appreciation is very much appreciated, but our work is never truly done. More so than ever, the responsibility to maintain a legendary sub rests in the hands of ordinary Apes.

VOTE YOUR SHARES!!](https://preview.redd.it/8uqyy2nm92471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fa877a494897aae3a5bc1f2804b8e14d958c1a6)](https://preview.redd.it/8uqyy2nm92471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fa877a494897aae3a5bc1f2804b8e14d958c1a6)

SATORI dev, 2021 colourised

The shills are *absolutely furious* about what we've been up to the past week. It's as if they [need this allegedly-impossible creation of ours shut down post-haste](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrx4pu/onslaught_of_antisatori_fud_gives_me_hope/) - desperation is in the air, and it tells me everything I need to know.

As the informatics arms-race between SATORI and its adversaries heats up, I'd like to make everyone aware of emerging stratagems and what they mean for the Ape community, so we're all well-equipped to deal with anything thrown at us ahead of time.

Solicitations, trolling & phishing in DMs

This tactic is as old as FUD itself, but it hasn't been this prevalent in months - the working theory is that the impostors suddenly have a load of accounts unable to post lying around, and wish to make use of them somehow. So, if you get any suspicious messages pushing "investment advice" or similar, please report these to Reddit and our mod team.

A lot of these are Meltdown trolls that thrive on the attention, so I wouldn't recommend engaging or 'putting them on blast' - but if you insist, our friends from [r/scambait](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/) have plenty of advice on the matter.

Bad karma

Since the restrictions, Apes whose accounts barely make it above the karma limit have [found themselves under attack by bots downvoting all their submissions, pulling them back below the threshold.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsij2i/are_bots_and_shills_down_voting_apes_below_the/)

Think about it - if professional FUD-mongers can't spread FUD directly, the second-worst thing they can do is attack solid content to prevent it from being seen. These attacks are exactly why we set SATORI to run in reverse and approve Apes, as well as using it to gather data on new tricks.

We're currently in discussions regarding what else can be done to prevent or counter such surreptitious acts; suggestions accepted. For the time being, it's up to everyone to be active in upvoting the good, downvoting the bad and reporting the *really* bad. Not only does this help a clear sub - it also lets us learn about the shills and strike back more effectively.

As with $GME as a stock, every vote matters.

Leveraging Apes and the weekend ennui

On Saturday, a lot of us woke up to a *flood* of posts relating to a comment by a particular CNBC reporter. Sharing new info is a wonderful thing, but in this case, it was a deluge of the same content being repeated over and over again. As you can imagine, I was getting a ton of pings asking to sic the Terminators on these guys.

So, where was SATORI?

As [Bradduck explained in his ambassadorship comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nplhx7/game_stop/h05v5ec?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Interdiction Day, our setup is currently running on a per-user basis; a bit of negative sentiment doesn't necessarily make a shill. We've all woken up on the wrong side of bed, and one comment isn't enough for anyone to form an accurate verdict - whether they're an algorilla or a carbon-based, 100% organic, dip-buying ape.

We know that our adversaries are aware of this, and how they're countering it - their only hope at this point is to rely on otherwise well-behaved users to post content that dilutes or otherwise lowers the overall quality of the sub. That, and outright *stealing* accounts with AI approval or Superstonk posting histories in broad daylight - more on that later.

Their attempts to drag down karma on Apes' accounts reveals that they're just as interested in preventing top-tier submissions from gaining traction as they are in directly posting their own tosh. So, now that they're mostly unable to bring their own stuff into Superstonk, they're relying on us to do their work for them.

I took the liberty of checking the Melissa posters' accounts, and it turns out the vast majority of them were genuine Apes with solid and lengthy histories in Superstonk. No wonder our per-user security measures didn't bag 'em, they aren't supposed to.

It's the weekend, there aren't any crayons to watch and everyone's understandably miffed. But please, if you believe the meme/tracker/DFV tweet or similar you're about to submit may have been posted before, I implore you to check before posting.

The Superstonk jungle - especially the [Knights of New](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nti5ms/knights_of_new/) - will appreciate it dearly.

Tag teams

Struck with a sudden shortage of useable accounts, our adversaries have had to pick their battles a bit more wisely - as opposed to regurgitating the same thing over and over, getting banned, migrating to a new account et cetera. One way to accomplish this is by tag-teaming - setting up a wedge of sorts and sowing drama on both sides.

[Here's a brief yet insightful comment covering this tactic, and how to deal with it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsmutv/complacency_kills_dont_let_satori_lull_you_into_a/h0nk71l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Hacked accounts & a final note on account security

We have received a surge in reports of Superstonk users' accounts getting compromised It would appear that accounts able to post (i.e. approved by SATORI or above the karma/age requirements) are more likely to be targeted, but this could happen to anyone - don't get complacent.

Please refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nojpde/best_security_practices_for_protecting_self_and/) for a comprehensive rundown on account security, in addition to other useful advice on the matter. Also, friendly reminder not to click any [suspicious links.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

NO hax for you Kenny

TA;DR

While the sub is significantly cleaner than it used to be, SATORI still has a long way to go. Since deployment, we've seen a trend towards attacks that don't rely on publicly 'revealing' their accounts. The might of 375,000+ AI-assisted gorillas is just too much.

Instead of the old hit-and-run spamming, our foes are resorting to sneakier methods: hacking accounts, manipulating karma, sliding into people's DMs and otherwise causing trouble outside the public eye. In addition, they're increasingly relying on genuine Apes to accidentally drown out the good stuff, being increasingly unable to bring it into the sub themselves.

This scenario leaves far more responsibility to individual Apes than what we had before, so it is up to each and every one of us to deal with it appropriately.

A sub is only as strong as its weakest link - B.H.V.F., and be strong.
