So this is my first attempt at trying to add value to our beloved ape community. I decided to see what I could find out about this closed meeting the SEC had on deck for today. What I found is mostly above my head but it does sound to me that someone(s) about to get pinched?

<https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events>

SEC Meeting noted here:

<https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-032521>

From the above page I clicked on the "Sunshine Act Notice" link: <https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg032521.htm>

In 3rd paragraph under MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED:

"The General Counsel of the Commission, or his designee, has certified that, in his opinion, one or more of the exemptions set forth in *5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(3), (5), (6), (7), (8), 9(B) and (10) and 17 CFR 200.402(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(9)(ii) and (a)(10)*, permit consideration of the scheduled matters at the closed meeting."

So I googled "5 U.S.C. 552b" and found this:

<https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552b>

Under (c) -

**(3)**disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than [section 552 of this title](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552)), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

TL;DR

A player in the game may be about to get pinched?

I'm out of my depth on this but it feels pertinent to marble ape brain. I don't feel right tagging our most wrinkled of ape brains here until more of yall check it out and make sure I'm not wasting folks time. I suppose it's all speculation regardless.Enjoy!

EDIT: as my ape fam correctly points out this may or MAY NOT have anything to do with GME. Confirmation bias led me to post. Maybe it's our boys and maybe it ain't.
