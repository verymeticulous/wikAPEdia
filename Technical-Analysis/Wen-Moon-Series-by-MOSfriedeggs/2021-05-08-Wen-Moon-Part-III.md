[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

Greetings once again [🦍](https://emojipedia.org/gorilla/) as promised, this post will be a follow up on my two previous DD if you want to read them or challenge me on my predictions both links are below.

[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2witz/wen_moon_taddelliot_wavegamma_squeezeoptions/) wen moon ?[II](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4b6kf/wen_moon_ii_wen_in_doubt/). wen moon ? II : wen in doubt

Alot of Good DDs came out recently so I wanted to join in on the action and offer my own perspective I also wanted to follow up the prediction that were made last week. In combination I will back my observations using Wardenlive endgame [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5me5g/the_mother_of_all_wedges_an_endgame_dd_technical/) and Trading Sciences TA [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDSUjSdixA). Once again I'll keep everything short and straight to the point.

PART 1 : MOAW revisited (MOTHER OF ALL WEDGES)

*If you haven't read Warden* [*DD*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5me5g/the_mother_of_all_wedges_an_endgame_dd_technical/) *on the MOAW i highly recommend it, my first* [*DD*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2witz/wen_moon_taddelliot_wavegamma_squeezeoptions/) *that came out a week prior also explains in sort of a* *TLDR* *version.*

As you can see on the images below we broke out the APEX of the wedge on the upside, finishing green on friday at 161.11$, this to me is extremly bullish. In my second [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4b6kf/wen_moon_ii_wen_in_doubt/) I predicted that last week Hedgies would try to bring us below that RED line to try and break our *bullish* momentum and ho boy! did they try. On monday and tuesday they attacked us viciously bringing in us down from 177 to 151.86.

Once again our diamonds hands prevailed.

PART II : The Unbreakable Trendline

In my second [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4b6kf/wen_moon_ii_wen_in_doubt/), I theorized that as long as this trendline would hold we would be in good shape, I've also pointed out that Hedgies would attack it hard, as they did earlier last week. I was happy to see that it held. If Shorts are not able to break it in the near future, we are gonna see 200 soon-ish meaning we are indeed inevitable mid-long term, find out why in part 3-4.

To ruin this trend they would need to sink Gamestop below 150-140 and decrease it's price daily over a month, but I don't see APES letting it happen because all we know is BUY+HODL 🚀.

PART 3 : Elliot Wave Theory

In his latest upload titled [THE MOASS IS COMING](https://youtu.be/riDSUjSdixA?t=199) pro trader Trading Sciences explain why he thinks we are in complexe correction in regards to the Elliot Waves and gives possible scenarios as to where our beloved stock could land in the next few months, but he seems conviced that a price between 800$-2100$ is a possibility in the near future. This seems to in sync with my theory about our trendline, where over a few months the stonk will just slowly rise up despite hedge funds best effort to keep it down.

[800$+++ Target price](https://preview.redd.it/gd9el5d1ryx61.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d952d148d7e3e93b68f5b4a48f4c140cce21f6c)

PART 4 : Options / Gamma Squeeze / MOASS

As far as Options goes nothing has really changed since my last post, things are still looking super bullish. Here's why; From 200$ up, Hedgies are massively exposed due to the ammount of synthetics shorts and the insane number of call options at the 200/300/400 and 800 strike price. As of right now Gamestop has a *40%* chance of trading above 800$ in july. Explanation in the [video](https://youtu.be/riDSUjSdixA?t=629) starts at 10:30.

TLDR : BUY + HOLD and vote !!!! , no but seriously all you have to do at this point and wait for the inevitable to happen I strongly believe that very soon Gamestop will break out. I will personally buy more in a few weeks and consolidate my xx @ 150. In regards to all the information in this DD, I believe we've been Bullish and on our way to the moon ever since DFV last tweet, he knew. Love you all and I hope you enjoy this post.
