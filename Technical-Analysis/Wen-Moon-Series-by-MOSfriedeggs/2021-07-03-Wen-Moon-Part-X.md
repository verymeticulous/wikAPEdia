Hello everyone 🦍, this DD will be the last one I publish untill the squeeze hence the title Endgame. The reason is simple ; I strongly believe we are in the final stage of the battle with the crooked hedge funds and their agents.

In my humble opinion there is no reason for me to provide more technical analysis in the near future , or perhaps evidence for a squeeze. Hundreds of DD, countless data and hours of interview with some of the most brilliant mind and expert out there should be enough to convince you that ---

*The things set in motion cannot be stopped.*

It's been one hell of a journey from DFV first YOLO post to the recent and exciting development with the company and every crazy event 🍌 that happened in between.

I've had the time of my life sharing these DD and shitposting with you guys.

I'm ZEN as can be and I hope everyone else is.

at this point I think our hands are nothing but pure diamonds. 💎

🍻

*without further ado*, let's dive in...

PART 1 - Basic charting 🌙

Without using any indicators whatsover and just by looking at our daily chart things seem to be progressing well.

[u/chayse1984](https://www.reddit.com/u/chayse1984/) pointed out in his DD that GME are currently about to break out of a cup and handle while being inside of a bullish pennant.

For my smooth 🧠 out there it means we have roughly a 66% chance of breaking out on the upside to a bare minimum of about *450$.*

*(measurement from the bottom to the top of the cup on the log chart).*

What's also interesting to note; it would bring us exactly where Elliot Wave guy told us the 3rd wave would bring us. 👨‍💻 *(This was also double checked by Youtuber Trading Sciences;* [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzT5JRMQCg)*)*

*When two different analysis made by numerous people point in a direction it's best to assume that these speculation have a very good chance of happening for the simple fact that it plays a key factor in the psychology of trading in individuals.*

Chart as analyzed by chayse and myself , cup and handle insine a bullish pennant supported by a trendline.

SOLVING THE CUP AND HANDLE

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 10 : Endgame ■ Final TA](https://preview.redd.it/a5g0kt6bc2971.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc05fbab34daab3532572839be44ce1bccfa3ed6)](https://preview.redd.it/a5g0kt6bc2971.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc05fbab34daab3532572839be44ce1bccfa3ed6)

The first thing we need to find out is how the cup and handle will play out.

It's pretty normal for a cup and handle to retrace as much as 50% from their initial high before a blue sky breakout or in our case a trip to the moon. As illustrated below this would be the most possible scenario in my opinion, this would also trap bears causing even more buying pressure if the trend changes rapidly.

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 10 : Endgame ■ Final TA](https://preview.redd.it/a4uhxj7dc2971.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=118d66144f615d53d7f0002a2cb195c11fed5613)](https://preview.redd.it/a4uhxj7dc2971.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=118d66144f615d53d7f0002a2cb195c11fed5613)

GME could go as low as 172$/173$ before breaking out.

This to me is another scenario also bullish but less probable, we could see the trend reverse itself as soon as monday and we would resume our journey to the top. Such a weak downtrend would indicate that shorts and bears are now completly powerless, *they don't even believe in their own thesis anymore.*

If GME remains above 200$ and start to break out by the end of the week, HOLY MOLY.

Hedgies are fucked

If you wish to understand more about Elliot Wave theory I recommend reading Elliot Wave Guy DD or watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzT5JRMQCg).

Elliot Wave theory applied to GME

Now we can put all the pieces of the puzzle togheter and it look something like this, two different technique ; same result. Very bullish but also realistic and works perfectly in accordance with William O'Neil trading strategy about the cup and handle theory and Elliot Wave theory.

HODL 🚀

Part 2 - In depth T.A 🌙

MACD

Downtrend is getting weaker and weaker, bears are fucked. Just give it a little more time and this baby is gonna crossover like it always did in the past, as you can see everytime is crosses-over we raise our floor a little bit.

MACDADDY GETTING READY TO 🌊💧🍾

RSI

RSI on GME has a tendency to bounce of the median line (GREEN) and explode back up, right now we're consolidating but as you can see it's just a matter of time until it breaks out again, we can also confirm that the current downtrend is very weak and that APES are in control.

Wow Kenny ! Is that the best you could do ?

EMA

*The exponential moving average (**EMA**) is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The* *EMA* *is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.*

The EMA on the weekly timeframe is looking great, the EMA on the daily timeframe reminds me of the way we traded back in march. Consolidating before a break out. Also BOOLISH LFGGGGG

WEEKLY EMA

[![r/Superstonk - wen moon 10 : Endgame ■ Final TA](https://preview.redd.it/hz8asvf5h2971.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=d479b70b780744c94219d935f2ad2d20a158bc55)](https://preview.redd.it/hz8asvf5h2971.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=d479b70b780744c94219d935f2ad2d20a158bc55)

Weekly EMA looking stunning.

GME will most likely bounce off the 20 EMA on the WEEKLY and RIP

DAILY EMA

Last time we traded in between the 20/50 EMA things went crazy afterward.

Huu guys.. 🚀

VOLUME

Well I think everyone has noticed by now that the volume is drier than the Sahara desert. But fear not, this is very similar to what happened back in July.

Low volume pullback like this are very attractive to investors as they present low risk high rewards scenario.

In simple term FOMO will be kicking in soon, and the people who didn't buy this will be mad because it's pretty much the last chance you've got at buying GME at a some ''reasonable price''.\
I'm sure if you could bo back in time and buy at 4$ / 40$ you would go all in, don't miss out again. Because you might never see the low 200's ever.

*Also I'd like to point out how similar the chart is looking to the previous run up to 75$ from last summer.*

This isn't financial advice, just common sense.

''awww man.. I wish I would have bought at 200$ but I wasn't sure I mean GME is a dying company on paper, right guys ? '' - Some fundamental investor

BOLLINGER BANDS

*Bollinger bands* *help determine whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. They are used in pairs, both upper and lower* *bands* *and in conjunction with a moving average.*

The Squeeze

The squeeze is the central concept of Bollinger Bands®. When the bands come close together, constricting the moving average, it is called a squeeze. A squeeze signals a period of low volatility and is considered by traders to be a potential sign of future increased volatility and possible trading opportunities.

The superstonk is about to go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR , the chart is screaming BUY ME alot of people will miss out on life changing money because ''mUh DyInG BrIcK aNd MoRtaR StorE'' .

HVP by Bali Purr (Historical Volatility Percentile)

It's my theory that DFV and many big traders used this signal as a confirmation to buy Gamestop last summer, it rarely gives a signal so when it happens it's huge.

it gave a signal *last month !!!!!!!* , usually it takes a few weeks to breakout add a few more weeks for volatility to reach a peak. *As we know volatility is key for us*. We broke out!!!! SO.. in a few weeks we will MOST LIKELY SEE a HUGE SPIKE in volatility A.K.A TENDIES. 🍗🍗🍗🍗

HOLY FUCKING MOLY, this is it. Cherry on top of the sundae :D

PART 3 : FINAL WORD AND TLDR 🌙

If you are doubting Techical Analysis let me give you a quote from the book *trading in the zone* by Mark Douglas :

*'' Individuals develop behavior patterns, and a group of individuals interacting with one another on a consistent basis form collective behavior patterns. These behaviors are observable and quantifiable and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability. -- in a sense technical analysis allow you get into the mind of the market. As a method for projecting future price movement, technical analysis as turned out to be far superior to a purely fundamental approach. '*'

EVERY INDICATOR IS SCREAMING BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Like I said in the intro I feel like everything is going as it should right now. If you are anxious or feeling fudy, just know that everything is gearing for a move that is gonna literally break the space-time continuum. 🚀

Everything is a buy right now, EVERYTHING. We're past the point (I THINK) where we'll ever get GME at a cheap price . Buy if you can HODL if you can't.

If I could go back in time and tell my past self to buy more at 40$ trust I would but I won't have the regret of not going all in at 200$ , I just maxed out.

XX hodler till infinity. 🚀

I will see ya'll on the moon very soon. 🚀

~~SHILLS BTFOD~~
