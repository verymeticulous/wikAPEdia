Sup apes, Elliot Waves guy here.

I wanted to write this post because for one, my last post blew up way more than I ever expected, so I have a lot of new readers now. If you missed my previous post, you can check it out here (seriously, I can't thank this community enough for all your love and support) <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwyj77/elliot_waves_and_gme_why_im_jacked_to_infinity/>

This post isn't gonna be going over technical levels as much, rather a general overview of why I believe the stock price is about to take off from a technical perspective only, and how it all ties into the bigger picture. I also noticed on my last post, there was an issue with the images loading when I added them directly to the post, so from now on I'll just be linking everything via [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/)

I had to make a small edit in my recent post as I didn't analyze the proper fib ratio when saying 213 appeared to be the bottom. In EW theory, wave 2 typically retraces 61.8% of wave 1, though the 61.8% level I used in that analysis was actually from the start of a 5 wave impulse within the cycle, not the actual cycle. I have circled the proper fib ratios for the apparent Cycle 1 and 2 that appear to have completed:

Hopefully you caught my edit in my recent post, but if you didn't, this puts our bottom of cycle 2 at 201. We did not hit this level to the T, though given the nature of the rebound from the lows yesterday, I'm inclined to say that we will not see us hit 201... though if we do, expect a bounce:

Wave 3 is often the longest and strongest of the 5 wave impulse, but what I want you to note that is specifically interesting about this specific situation with GME, we are in a 3 within a 3 within a 3, just starting the Cycle 3 (the order is grand super cycle, super cycle, cycle, primary, intermediate, and so on)

In the image I'm about to link, do note just because a price target based on the line I drew is on a certain date, do not bank on anything happening by said date. This is solely for visualization purposes. For reference our cycle 1 took over 2 months to pan out, though this can be attributed to many outside factors causing us to trade sideways for a considerable amount of time (circled, March 24 to June 8). Grand super cycle is illustrated in blue, super cycle in yellow, and cycle in white:

Just for reference: I'm gonna link a car/truck company and a company that does electricity generally (boomer stocks are great examples of EW in action, also automod doesn't let me use other tickers lol) note how wave 3 is the strongest for both:

Cars and trucks that starts with eff: <https://imgur.com/yG6itXH>

Electricity, generally : <https://imgur.com/FLfk2Xy>

Granted, these were not a 3 within a 3 within a 3, but even from a visual standpoint on boring ass stocks, you can see Elliot Wave theory come to fruition.

As for GME short term, I can't quite give short term upside targets yet, as I am yet to see a primary 1 and 2 complete. To verify this action, I'm looking for a strong ish move to the upside followed by a 50%-61.8% correction of that move.

This is THE time to really be loading up, to be honest, from an EW standpoint, this is about as good a setup you can dream of, the risk/reward from a technical standpoint is worth drooling over, and this isn't even factoring in a short squeeze.

Do note, when the rocket really kicks off, and I mean well above 5 figures, this is when I'll have to take out my big crayon and draw that whole movement set as a 1, if that makes sense. Worrying about that later haha, for now all i know is buy, hodl, buy some more, okay maybe some more, and hodl for 8 figures or more.

Will try to post every day of the trading week by popular demand, in the event my account gets attacked (as has happened to previous well known DD creators in the past), check out my twitter: <https://twitter.com/gavinmayreal> Much easier to do small updates on their as well 🚀

I just started posting my analysis on twitter, disregard the follower count hahaha I used to be a youtuber back in the day, sort of retired cause I don't really like where it's gone, but if people would like I can start posting genuine tutorials on my Youtube.

GME? bullish af. Shorts? fuk. Tits? Jacked.

My Cycle 3 targets are as follows: <https://imgur.com/g80KXrX>

Please remember, these are CYCLE 3 targets, not intermediate or primary, meaning don't be upset if we dont break 500 this week... It is inevitable that we will in due time, and the ball is really about to start rolling. Can it just be Monday already?

also note, quad witching comes up this Friday:

TLDR: GME is at the bottom of a cycle 3, within a super cycle 3, within a grand super cycle 3. this is the most bullish EW trading setup possible, and EW traders dream of finding this setup. These low prices won't last 🚀 Hopefully Automod doesn't block it this time 🤞

Edit: lol super random, I bought assassins creed Valhalla from my local GameStop recently, if you know, what are the best weapons? 🤣
