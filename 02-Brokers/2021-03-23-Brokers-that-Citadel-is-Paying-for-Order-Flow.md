I hate rewriting a post that is already perfect, but Reddit's spam filter is now removing all references to WallStreet on Parade... the fight is REAL..

Anyway, the header says it all. Citadel is literally buying your positions from nine online brokers. I've taken the links and embedded them here. Please take time to read the OP from Wallstreet on Parade.. it's INCREDIBLE.

What does this mean? After you buy $GME, do not place limit orders signaling where you're comfortable buying and selling, quit placing stop losses, stop everything. This immediately notifies market makers where your 'trigger' points are.

Just. F*CKING. HODL

Keep them in the dark.

Not financial advice.
