[DD 👨‍🔬](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/search?q=flair_name%3A%22DD%20%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%94%AC%22&restrict_sr=1)

I had this idea.. What if Citadel has dirt on the DTCC and that's why they're letting this shit go on?

My first thought was to look into any relationship between Kenny G and Michael Bodson, head of DTCC.

*Insert 20 mins of DD, found no initial Kenny/Mikey connection, then decided to look into Mr DTCC's LinkedIn page*

Michael Bodson worked for Morgan Stanley for 20 years from Jun 1986 - Jul 2006. Doesn't say anything about him before that. *How did he get this Managing director role?*

Says from 1976 to 1980 he was in Boston College. Then there's a 6 year gap that says he's a managing director at Morgan Stanley. What happened between those 6 years?

I'd like to know.

*Insert Googling*

<https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board/michael-bodson>

Says:

*".. held a number of senior management positions with Morgan Stanley over a 20-year period. In his last position at Morgan Stanley, he was Global Head of the Institutional, Retail and Asset Management Operations Department. He previously served as Divisional Operations Officer for the Institutional Securities Group and Head of the Enterprise Information Group. He served as Head of Finance, Administration and Operations for Morgan Stanley Japan in Tokyo, and prior to that, he held similar responsibilities for Morgan Stanley Asia in Hong Kong. Prior to joining Morgan Stanley, he worked at Bear Stearns and Price Waterhouse. "*

Wait wait wait... hold up.

Michael Dodson, head of DTCC worked at Morgan Stanley. Prior to that he worked at Bear Stearns?

And what the fuck is Price Waterhouse?

YO I THINK I FOUND A RABIT HOLE!!

*Insert Price Waterhouse Google*

<https://www.pwc.com/>

*PricewaterhouseCoopers is a multinational professional services network of firms, operating as partnerships under the PwC brand. PwC ranks as the second-largest professional services network in the world and is considered one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with Deloitte, EY and KPMG.*

So many ways we can Google this....

Let's start with "michael bodson price waterhouse"

It just keeps showing the same LinkedIn bio. Let's remove the bear. (giggity)

Google: "michael bodson price waterhouse -bear"

Ooo interesting:

<https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2015/pages/management-committee.html>

CTRL+F "Price"

Look what popped up:

Susan Cosgrove Managing Director, Chief Financial Officer

Susan Cosgrove is Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer, leading DTCC's global finance and treasury teams and overseeing the company's efforts to further strengthen its financial processes and capital position. She is also responsible for procurement, real estate, corporate services and location strategy.

Cosgrove was previously Managing Director and General Manager of Settlement and Asset Services, overseeing all depository businesses. Prior to this role, she was the General Manager for DTCC's Equity and Fixed Income Clearing Services. Cosgrove is a member of DTCC's Management Committee, and she is Co-chair of the New Initiatives Committee. She also serves as a member of the board of directors for Deriv/SERV, Omgeo and Pencil.org, a not-for-profit organization leading collaboration between business and education communities.

Prior to joining DTCC in 1999, she served as a Senior Vice President at Lehman Brothers in charge of Audit and Compliance for the company's Americas division. Before Lehman, she worked at Maxcor Financial Group for 10 years as Chief Financial Officer and Head of Compliance. Cosgrove began her career as a Senior Auditor for PricewaterhouseCoopers in its Financial Services Group.

Side note: This popped up in the middle of my researching... lmao

[Coincidence? Maybe lmao](https://preview.redd.it/hby96j5jzex61.jpg?width=625&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18fedac97d4dc4e7d8a0a972e74a702b7cec9278)

INTERESTING.

So the DTCC has at least 2 people in Chief positions who worked for Price Waterhouse.

This seems important.

*Google google google*

Found this:

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/14/pricewaterhousecoopers-lehman-brothers-administration>

[Price Waterhouse Coopers profited 322 million Euros off the collapse of Lehman Brother's. INTERESTING!](https://preview.redd.it/f642crekwex61.jpg?width=1261&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7037bf86950a947d207d8fe97e183d3b33a2b673)

So wait wait wait WAIIIT.

When exactly did Michael Bodson go from Morgan Stanley to DTCC?

*Alt+Tab to LinkedIn*

Mar 2007

*(It doesn't say that on the page, I just added in for dramatic effect)*

Ayeee so Mikey got a ~~puppet~~ managing position at the DTCC the same month banks started to realize they were fucked? After previously working at Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns? Hmmm...

And now we know at least 2 Chief officers worked previously at PwC which profited 322 million from Lehman's collapse...

Let's google "PwC DTCC LinkedIn" and see how many more connections we can find.

AHHHH There u have it folks. The current COO of Citadel was on the board of directors at the DTCC while serving as CFO at the time.

That's the last piece of the puzzle for me. I don't need to look any further.

So let's review what we've learned:

The DTCC AND Citadel are both almost entirely made up of people who worked at a company called PwC which profited 322M from Lehman's collapse.

Former employees going back and forth between all 3 companies. Would be super simple to share information and palm favors.

Like for example..

Easily approving financial statements when Citadel obviously does SHADY SHIT:

[Did ya'll even read anything? I bet you didn't. I bet you just approved their financials and ignored all their naked shorting over the years because Cindy gave you a BJ at a frat party in 89'.](https://preview.redd.it/xnicek7l6fx61.jpg?width=1398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fafdb5516b9e0beec00a8b789311157b2ab245f0)

I started this trying to find a connection between Kenny and Michael but found myself going down a rabbit hole that any normal sane person would be terrified to post.

[lmao last time I posted something like this, I got death threats. This one might be legit.. Pray for me guyz.](https://preview.redd.it/0t8g7tswcfx61.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d46227fa9df5dd28a41b4e02f8e8e875b0fe879d)

Just for shits and giggles let's see how far PwC is from Citadel.

[MOTHER OF GOD](https://preview.redd.it/k8nboe66zex61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61865d4886121f7ed2ceefb5cf067f3483fe20b2)

12 minute walk from PwC to Citadel.

This is just my opinion but based on this information, I think this is the reason why things have been moving so slowly. This mini shadow organization that's made up of all these people who worked for the same firms, even interns went from 0 to 100 real quick. High ranking positions, probably as puppets for a larger entity. *"Do this and that when we tell you to, and on paper you'll be kings and queens"*

What does this mean? What is the point?

Based on the proposed legislation changes, it appears to me that someone's tired of their shit. And closing in on them little by little and they're running around terrified someone's gonna see through all their shady activities.

If I'm right, and they realized shit was about to hit the fan, they'd probably be...... up late.... on the weekends.... shredding all evidence of their fuckery.......... Hey wait, aren't there pics of lights on at all these buildings???

TL;DR: A company called PwC profited 322M Euros off the collapse of Lehman Brother's. This company had many many employees who went from working at PwC straight to DTCC and Citadel. PwC is 12 minutes walk from Citadel. The head of DTCC Michael Bodson used to work at PwC and Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns. He started working for DTCC the same month banks started to shit themselves, March 2007.

Gamestop is 2008 pt 2. Same players. Same tactics. Same strategies. Different company names. The end is near for all of them and they're most likely all freaking the fuck out worse than we thought. HODL.

*Edit: Thanks for the awards but I'd rather ya'll spend those on GME.*

*Message to Citadel, PwC, DTCC, whoever else is involved:*

*Yo, maybe I'm completely wrong. Who knows. BUT the longer this shit goes on, the deeper we apes will be looking. And we're retarded. We can't help ourselves. We'll keep looking and looking and pointing shit out. We are the uncomfortable autistic child in the room saying very uncomfortable things that the adults don't want known publicly.*

*Everyone knows you're doing some kinda shady shit, no one can definitively prove any of it but... SOONER OR LATER we're gonna stumble on something LEGIT Legit. And it's gonna fuck you up real bad. Worse than what ever covering would cost you. So you're better off just covering so we take our tendies and go.*

Edit 2:

Of course shills are gonna shill. Ape they are the 4 big accounting firms. DUH that's the point. One or more of them are in on this bullshit but PwC did the last opinion on them. PwC has deeper ties. PwC as a whole may not be in on it, I'm saying a few key employees could easily do favors. Theres major corruption. Shills are missing the point that Citadel and DTCC are intimate together. Idgaf about PwC I'm saying this is a tie to DTCC and Citadel.
