Here's what today's heat map looks like for Citadel's long holdings at market close. I went ahead and gathered up Melvin's as well, and created a second heat map. There's a lot of overlap between them, but enough differences to be interesting. Citadel has $200B AUM, while Melvin has/had $22B, so Citadel has 10x the influence on prices, if/when they are liquidating.

As I suspected they might, HD and PG both took a dive today. Also, there were declines in their bank stocks, Disney, and all their healthcare, while tech stocks made a limited comeback. Their Zoom and BABA holdings did well, while the FAANG stocks were mixed today.

While looking at supplemental reports in 13D/13G reports since Feb 16, Citadel has been on a buying spree of SPACs. Not sure what they're up to there, but the list is long: [Citadel 13D/13G](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/citadel+investment+group/44/latest-13dg-filings/#/). They slowed down after April 21, when the SEC announced that they would have to treat them as liabilities, not assets. [SEC Ruling news](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/04/13/how-sec-ruling-cuts-spacs-action/)

Melvin's heatmap for today:

I also researched Susquehanna International Group, but they have very few longs to look at. I'll keep digging to see if I'm missing something. They might be exclusively short, so they don't have to disclose in a 13F.

I researched Virtu Financial, but they seem to be more of an HFT and market maker and don't publish much in terms of long positions. They only publish in their 13F a $1B portfolio, with a sprinkling of index funds, SPACs, and Docusign, altogether maybe 5% of their reported total portfolio. I wonder if they're exclusively shorts, which they don't have to disclose. That might make them the weakest of the SHFs, if they're also naked shorting.

Jane Street Group is almost entirely in options, with huge parts of its $200B portfolio on both calls/puts on Tesla, Amazon, SPY, BABA, IEF, GLD, Netflix, Apple, Nvidia, Shopify, Salesforce, the list goes on. They even bought PUTs on Berkshire Hathaway? Betting against Berkshire Hathaway? The overlap in their puts/calls with Citadel's long holdings is REMARKABLE, ie. not a coincidence in my book. Almost every ticker can be found in both, except that Jane Street is playing derivatives only. Disney, Adobe, Salesforce, Google, Boeing, Micron. It's weird. Any wrinkly apes with ideas on their connections to Citadel please speak up.

Edit: As [u/bbbooneville](https://www.reddit.com/u/bbbooneville/) suggested, it might be of particular interest to also look at just the largest long positions of Melvin, as they are the most lightly capitalized of the known shorts ($2.75B infusion from KG/Steve Cohen), so their liquidation is likely to be first. I just pulled a list of their top long holdings and then removed Visa, MasterCard, and Facebook, as their massive market caps mean any Melvin move wouldn't shift the price much. Enjoy!
