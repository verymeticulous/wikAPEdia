Hello APES!

Good morning! It's Me, Gherkinit, bring you another day of crayons and tea leaves.

So some good news on the GME front we sold 3.5 million Shares at a cost average of $157. Guess this means the new value of GME's post-squeeze minimum is $157 , sorry to all the shorts who have a cost basis below this number. You might get margin called.

We had an amazing climb out of the poke-ball resistance zone yesterday and are looking for new highs today as long whales scramble to pick up GME nice and cheap before it moons.

Is this bullish? You tell me.

Overall I think we had a good day up 5.37 percent and up day is a win against the bear side. Not very much volume in the latter half of the day. Looking for moves upwards of that 180 resistance we got stuck on today moving into the 185-200 channel in the pre-market or tomorrow will put us in a strong position.

I'm so sorry for the automod issues that occurred earlier today I do not know if it was server side or reddit but I tried to keep you all updated. If you need up to date information and are unable to watch on YouTube during any reddit outages, our discord has a live audio stream. I just want to provide other options for anybody looking as reddit has been known to not handle high traffic moments well.

Thank you all again for you support, awards, and help. All of you are really making this whole thing feel very worthwhile and I love the Company!

Thank you again and see you tomorrow,

gherkinit

Edit 14 3:22

Power hour is looking lackluster no volume and we can just end between 176-180

Edit 13 2:52

Still sideways not a lot happening. You guys know the deal no volume = no fun.

Edit 12 2:09

So sorry the automod got me for having sub 500 karma...

I posted some updates in the comments to keep it alive. We are trading sideways slightly upward on very low volume into power hour. I missed you all. Testing 180 on low volume.

Edit 8 11:00

Head and shoulders forming sloppy but that's what I'm gonna call. Might see a small dip to the 175 resistance

Edit 6 10:31

Volume picking up as we push through VWAP, nice uptrend

Fighting for 180 chop volume is down right now.

Edit 4 9:58

Morning dip could happen if we continue to breakdown from this 180 support

Edit 3 9:46

Dropping below support at 180 could lead to a nice sale

Edit 2 9:42

Looking like we are gonna chop a bit at VWAP

Edit 1 9:35

Excellent open volume 1MM in the first five minutes short and long pressure were about equal,turning around to the upside as long pressure wins out

Pre-Market Analysis

Pre-Edit 9:29

175k Volume slow but I think it will pick up

Pre-Edit 2 9:20

Looking good volume picking up crossed to the upside of VWAP going into the opening bell

Look at this Big Beautiful Breakout.

BBB

Pre-Edit 1 8:30

We are sitting comfortably @ 184.39 up 8.97% since closing bell. Normally on a slow day I would expect to gap-fill before climbing but I think we are going to just rocket as long whales scramble to buy more shares at a discount (More on this as volume picks up around 9)
