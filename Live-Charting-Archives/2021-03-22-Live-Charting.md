Will I do an earnings call stream? No. Sorry but I need peace and quiet to interpret the call. I will still accept questions on Kofi (Check my profile for details). I will answer your questions on Kofi in near realtime as the earnings call is going on. Thank you!

Edit 14 4:03PM:

UPDATE, I WILL BE STREAMING WEEKLY ON MONDAYS. SAME TIME 9:15PM EST.

Edit 13 4:00PM:

Great finish! Last minute buying spike helping us end around 194. Nothing too crazy, volume was still low. Good day overall! Still on schedule following the 172 diagonal.

Edit 11 3:18PM:

Power hour kicked in, not much action yet. Volume hasn't really picked up.

Edit 10 2:48PM:

Still low volume, expect sideways for now until volume ramps up.

Edit 7 2:28PM:

Volume still low. Nothing too interesting. Checkout my stream btw!

Edit 6 2:16PM:

Just to help you guys understand the state of the play, and to recap the stuff that got accidentally deleted, we are hugging the diagonal support for most of the day. Mostly trending sideways. Volume is extremely low.

Edit 5 2:14PM:

Reverting to the mean. Snapping across VWAP

Edit 4:

I will not be streaming again for a bit. Just need to take a break :D Takes a lot of time to set everything up.

I got a test Tuesday so I may not do my daily post. Sorry, midterms week!

The bottom half of this post was messed up. Sorry IDK what happened. Edits 1-3 disappeared and so did my intro :P Nothing much happened in those edits anyways. Checkout my below video! Just finished the stream a couple minutes ago.
