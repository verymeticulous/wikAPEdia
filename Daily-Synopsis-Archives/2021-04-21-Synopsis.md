Good morning San Diago,

A lot of USA banks closed today

It seems that today some banks are closed due to them apparently being afraid of "civil unrest".

The part that gives food for thought is that they didn't seem to be closed during the latest version of civil unrest, so was the damage so big last time they felt like they had to protect them this time?

Or are they planning on giving very bad news and expect civil unrest because of that?

I can vividly remember them doing something like this in 2008, we were told that we could not take out money from our accounts so they closed a lot of banks and boarded them up for this reason, I'm not saying it's the same reason now, it just makes me think back to it. as civil unrest due to the trial seems to me that's just an excuse.

This is a post of BOA, another member here also said they they would be shutting their west coast branches today, with last minute wording and no substance as to why. (this person has proven their identity to the mods).

Blackrock

thanks goes to [u/valthonis_surion](https://www.reddit.com/u/valthonis_surion/) for finding this

We aim to vote at 100% of meetings where our clients have given us authority to vote their shares, and therefore vote at approximately 16,000 shareholder meetings in approximately 85 markets each year. With regards to non-U.S. holdings, generally we estimate that we vote successfully at approximately 90% of meetings. Of the remaining, 8% are not voted due to shareblocking and 2% are not voted due to either the fund's leverage, impediments such as ballots received post cut-off date or post meeting date, or other restrictions like in-person attendance or power of attorney being required in order to vote.

Sounds to me that someone (blackrock) is ready to play.

(Also Blackrock seems to have confirmed that the proxy materials will be sent out the first week of May <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mut21d/vanguard_told_me_proxy_materials_will_be_sent_out/>)

this one also connects nicely (IMO) to this one

this pic eum... wow?

Seems like the Margin debt has increased immensely since 2020, like a fucking rocket and bounced so high that we may be seeing a lot of margin calls this year. again could be nothing but I've found that all these things usually don't "just happen" and there is a correlation between all.

[just like Credit Suise halts trading of one of its star traders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/muv6a8/here_you_go_getting_around_the_pay_wall/) due to risks.

Also kindof harkens back to this idea

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv740t/january_22_february_19_march_5_april_16_the_only/>

which in turn works with this: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv2j11/again_no_large_block_purchases_of_deep_itm_calls/>

No large blocks purchased anymore so... I have no idea what this means but what I do know is that it's weird to say the least.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.
