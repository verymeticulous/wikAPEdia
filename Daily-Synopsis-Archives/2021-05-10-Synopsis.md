Top Story- NSCC-006

There's been a lot of posts floating around this weekend pertaining to the new [NSCC-006 filing](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-006.pdf). Lots of hype, lots of mis-info, and we need to set the record straight first and foremost.

What does 006 do?:

IT DOES eliminate the 10 day waiting period before implementation after the DTCC and SEC approval process.

What 006 DOESN'T do:

IT DOES NOT implement any rules immediately. Including 002 or any others.

IT DOES NOT eliminate the need for the approval process on any rules including 002.

IT DOES NOT eliminate the extension already implemented on 002 or any others.

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily DD- Monday 05-10-2021 🍌🐈 GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCEMENT!! 🍌🐈](https://preview.redd.it/08044elpw6y61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a45785911869b39ec6abcfe7e156bcda2b0fac0)](https://preview.redd.it/08044elpw6y61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a45785911869b39ec6abcfe7e156bcda2b0fac0)

not it

THIS RULING DOES NOTHING FOR MOASS AS A STANDALONE RULE

*002 is still put off until June 21. It could be implemented well before then, we don't know. This is just the extended deadline. You can't deny that they are putting a LOT of rules in place that seem directly tied to GME and the exposure of naked short selling.*

[Here's a post that talks about it more in detail.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7jphk/nscc006_doesnt_change_much_but_looking_forward_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Negative Volume (Again)

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily DD- Monday 05-10-2021 🍌🐈 GIVEAWAY ANNOUNCEMENT!! 🍌🐈](https://preview.redd.it/d9sm8mpbv6y61.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4152f7c81d43c45d1dd76da8f6002361fc77bac)](https://preview.redd.it/d9sm8mpbv6y61.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4152f7c81d43c45d1dd76da8f6002361fc77bac)

Where go?

Remember when I posted last week [about the -1million volume anomaly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5pk8v/negative_1_million_volume_after_hours/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that happened on May 5 and I said it was most likely due to a CTS server reboot that caused a glitch? [Well, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n728ty/it_happened_again_last_night_2_million_volume/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) This time for -2 million. And once is an anomaly. Twice is something else entirely.

[And according to the wrinkly math here, it may have been happening for even longer under our noses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6x24u/finra_and_sec_says_volume_56_yesterday_was_17m/gxam4ot?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Totally trippin' Pink Cats theory 👽 : The dark pool orders being unable to execute caused the negative volume due to cancelled orders.

Let's Talk Politics (or don't)

[This post got everyone talking politics, and we need to clear a few things right here and now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n727qd/as_someone_works_as_an_advisor_for_policy_makers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

We know how eager everyone is to get involved and make a difference. However, please keep in mind that [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) is a place for people from around the world to get together to share news, information, memes and comments about stonks.

Our AMAs are for informational purposes only. Our guests are here to inform us and to answer YOUR questions.

We are not a political group. Mods will not spearhead any political campaign nor will we reach out to any politician on behalf of [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/).

There are several reasons for this, however the most important ones are:

1.  Many of us, including several Mods, are not US citizens.

2.  If [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) reaches out to potentially "friendly" or "open minded" US politicians to try and "educate" or "inform" them, this is what will happen:

    1.  Mods and influential [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) users will be targeted as "bad actors" who are attempting to exert foreign influence on US politicians and policy; and

    2.  Those politicians we reach out to, who may or may not be friendly, will be targeted as "compromised" and "under foreign influence/manipulation"

3.  The result? All of a sudden, any positive changes they are attempting to make will be seen as "an attack on American Sovereignty" because they are "compromised" by "foreign manipulation"

4.  Furthermore, politicians are not dumb. You can bet that many of them are lurking on this sub, reading, watching and learning. If they want to learn, they can and will do so.

If you want to get involved, all you have to do is watch our AMA with Dave Lauer or [read the transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7295i/david_lauer_ama_transcript_summary_22/). Here's a direct copy/paste from the transcript:

> **WHAT CAN WE DO?**There have been questions about what can we do and to me this is one of those things that we can do.Another thing is you can just continue to make your voice heard, you can file comment letters with the SEC or FINRA, that's an excellent way to get involved, they do read them and **they do listen to well thought out comments, or well-researched comments.**You can contact your members of Congress because these bills that are going to come up are going to be controversial and they need to hear that there are people out there that support them, for good reasons.You can make use of the SEC and Office of the Investor Advocate who is there to advocate on your behalf and is often focused on institutional investors but would probably like to hear more from retail.And Gary Gensler I think in his testimony before Congress is going to say that they're requesting public input on some of these exact issues.So I think getting involved like that is just an *excellent thing*.It's great to have more involvement and more perspectives in this market structure debate, versus most of the people that are involved generally work for the high-frequency firms, the exchanges, the broker-dealersThere are very few of us out there who are not beholden to one of those types of firms and who are making money, actively, off of the current market structure.

If our American apes wish to contact their representatives as individuals, please do so.

However, the Mod Team will not be contacting anyone on behalf of the community, nor will we be involved with organizing any "Master DD", slideshows, or political AMAs.

Many American apes are asking for information/websites/links on how to contact their representatives/SEC/FINRA.

But imma keep doing it anyway

Also, here's a message from [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/):

"This subreddit is public space. I think that's even true, legally considering. People all over the world come to reddit and join public forums. We won't condone anything against our rules.Politics must be relevant to the discussion. There are private chat groups and messaging alternatives for those who truly wish to organize.This subreddit is geared toward public discussion and sharing of knowledge and education.This is not a place to organize action on the political battlefield.However, if those organized actions rely on information gained from [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk) or other subreddits, that will not be on other community members or the moderators.We are here to facilitate public discourse, not censor information or discussion on the grounds of supposed involvement.In the end, we all have free will and free speech, and we moderators seek to keep the peace and nurture public discussion, not police it or censor it without good reason. "

.......With that said...

An update has been made to Rule 5, Improper Content:

No political posts. Any reference to politics must involve $GME directly.

This is the 1 corner of the internet where everyone is equal and none of that dirty talk gets in through the gates. Let's keep it that way as long as we can. There are plenty of other places on reddit to discuss politics, even as they pertain to GME. But there is only 1 superstonk 💖
