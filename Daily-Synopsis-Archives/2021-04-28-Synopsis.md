Listen, I want to make sure everyone understands how frickin' GLORIOUS it is that someone like [Dr. Susanne Trimbath](https://www.gminsight.com/bio-susanne-trimbath) is coming to spend time with us apes tomorrow. Do you remember how much it blew your mind when you read [The Everything Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)? Imagine figuring out this web of deceit in *1993*! She has been cruising around internet chatrooms and forums since before you had to collect AOL disks to chat all weekend on a 14K connection. This woman is a *legend.* Do you hear me? Everyone here is fascinated by the brilliant minds we've learned about on this journey like Dr. Michael Burry and [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/). I want you to understand that when it comes to these beautifully wrinkly brains that we love to pick...

Dr. Trimbath=Yoda

Are y'all getting HYPED yet?! Because I know I am! And I want to start today's daily by letting you guys in on a little secret. I guess it's not really a secret because I *was* given permission to share this with you today... I want to tell you about my conversation last night with our favorite wrinkly brain, [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/), who is also currently working on [House of Cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Part 2 while he does all this amazing research for the AMA.

He has been in contact with Dr. T and let me tell you... This dude is pumped about this AMA. You know why? Because after reading through [Naked Short & Greedy](https://www.ipgbook.com/naked--short-and-greedy-products-9781910151341.php?page_id=21), he got a GIGANTIC SHOT OF CONFIRMATION BIAS. AND HE IS JACKED! Do you realize what a big deal that is? The guy who taught us what [rehypothecated](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm) means just read about the same concepts that he describes in his DDs, but written by a professional with accolades, accomplishments, and experience that extends directly to the DTC itself. To quote Atobitt;

"Until now, her coverage has been under-reported and unappreciated. Radio hosts would have her on, then someone completely different the next day. This marks the beginning of a new saga for her, and apes.

Now, day in and day out, apes will be pushing for this. The fight is literally being brought to their doorstep. She's got the brains and the expertise, the resources, the credibility. And then there's the pissed off apes that want answers. This is the beginning. Enjoy it!" - [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/)**.**

Imagine going back to your February 5th self and telling them we would be talking with someone from the DTC. They're going to be speaking directly to apes on our little corner of the internet. Life is *wild* man.

So IDK about you, but when the smartest dude I've probably ever met is this impressed by someone, I'm *really* excited to hear what they have to say.

The [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzknu6/official_ama_dr_susanne_trimbath_phd_thursday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is tomorrow at 3PM EDT on our Superstonk Live YouTube Channel (NON-MONETIZED). Be there to watch a groundbreaking interview by apekind, for apekind!

This is as grassroots as it gets!

Proxy Voting

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-28-2021](https://preview.redd.it/1lb1fjkmiuv61.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4ad1484541caf8e8c561621fc39d3f5b455d80)](https://preview.redd.it/1lb1fjkmiuv61.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f4ad1484541caf8e8c561621fc39d3f5b455d80)

Please HODL

So you called Fidelity, or TDA, or whoever your broker is, and you sat on hold for 500 hours because a bunch of other monkeys were using their opposable thumbs to also call *their* brokers and... yeah. This is confusing and frustrating for some (especially the customer service reps 😅). First of all, let me tell you that if you haven't gotten your control number or proxy voting information yet from your broker, it's ok. Ape no panik.

What originally started as an initiative to compile broker experiences from around the sub, has now turned into just a simple reminder of a few things;

-   The earliest any broker will be sending you voting information is today, the 28th. Keep an eye on your broker inbox today and in the coming days for that info.

-   Some brokers may not give you your control number yet. They all have internal procedures to follow here. And remember... they are really having to scramble to find these shares.

-   Contacting your broker is the only way to know how they are handling the proxy vote and what their timeline of releases looks like.

-   This is going to take a little time. Brokers are not used to having this many shareholders interested in a proxy vote. *This is unprecedented*. Apes are literally changing the market and creating a new normal.

-   Once again, ONLY USE THE WEBSITE PROVIDED BY YOUR BROKER TO VOTE. DO NOT RELEASE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER ANYWHERE ELSE. This is your ticket to Tendieland. Don't you want to ride the roaring kitty coaster and have banana cotton candy on the moon with Papa Cohen? Then HANG ON TO THAT CONTROL NUMBER UNTIL VOTE TIME. Don't give it to $Crypt0King69420's twitter link please. Ape protecc golden banana.

-   Lots of brokers, especially Euro brokers, reported to be charging customers to vote. Yes it's legal. Yes it's kinda' sketch. Just like PFOF.

-   I've gotten several user reports that E-Toro does not allow you to vote, because they do not trade actual share certificates, they just trade based on the underlying value of the stock. Therefore they cannot reserve their customers the right to vote. I have not confirmed this with EToro, but with the number of reports I've gotten and seen around, I will defer to the comments and ultimately for you to call your broker for confirmation.

-   You are a shareholder. You have every right to do everything you can to get to exercise your right to vote and be involved in the decision making of a stock you like. So be vigilant, but also be kind to the people you interact with. Apes are making an [impression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx88v2/so_i_called_td_ameritrade_to_get_my_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) worldwide. Set a good example!

Citigroup $5.5 Billion Bond Offering

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-28-2021](https://preview.redd.it/bre0loqn5uv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=106c65bd2b9947ade945fa6d03c50e5d56e9afe7)](https://preview.redd.it/bre0loqn5uv61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=106c65bd2b9947ade945fa6d03c50e5d56e9afe7)

Bloomberg reports Citigroup Bond Offering

So I won't spend a lot of time on this because it's a lot of speculation from where I'm sitting, but it's definitely noteworthy. Citigroup just [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-results/big-banks-say-u-s-consumers-sturdy-as-businesses-quiver-with-growth-fears-idUSKBN1WU2BI) record breaking quarterly earnings. Above and beyond Wall Street expectations. Like, if you look at them on paper, they were *kickin ass and takin names* in the last quarter.

So why in the world would you need $5.5 Billion in liquidity so quickly after you were just talking about what an absolute Chad you are? Citigroup is sure setting aside a lot of emergency cash. I mean, yes this is speculation like I said. No I don't consider "a person with knowledge of the matter" any better a source than [u/ButtFarm69](https://www.reddit.com/u/ButtFarm69/) would be a good reference to put on a job application.

I'm not sure why none of us were able to confirm this on other news sites, but... Smells like a leak to me. That's just my opinion. :sips tea: I look forward to finding out what a bank needs that much cash on hand for. 👉👈

Automod... will be back....

[![r/Superstonk - Superstonk Daily 04-28-2021](https://preview.redd.it/co2fd491ruv61.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=a722b2cf28832535e2be64de3abdf7a49bcacb6e)](https://preview.redd.it/co2fd491ruv61.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=a722b2cf28832535e2be64de3abdf7a49bcacb6e)

Bragged on you a lil too early, automod

Yesterday I went over the new karma requirements for posting and commenting, and well as all of the different bells and whistles on the automod. Automod is a ~~terminator~~ reddit bot that is programmable and helps keep your community clean based on the parameters you set. And it's friggin amazing.

Well after bragging about the wonders of automod, we got tons of messages that automod had terminated their posts even though they surpassed the karma requirements. And then we realized [it was a site-wide issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/mzyo75/karma_is_busted_again_resulting_in_automod_issues/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Sooo.. the automod rules still stand, just please be patient as reddit works through the kinks (it's not mods fault this time yaaaaaayyy!!!)

Also, a kind reminder to please not contact mods directly (Rule 1) about not being able to interact in the sub due to karma requirements. There are lots of ways to [build karma](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-get-karma-on-reddit/). But we felt these karma requirements for the time being would help locate more imposters among us ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ trying to sway and deceive with FUD the closer MOASS gets. So far we have been receiving excellent feedback! Mods really appreciate your patience while we figure out the best way to keep the sub safe.

A note from your friendly local pink cat 🐈

Just want to slip this little note in here because this is an important point. I really tried to convey the deep sense of excitement I have for where this journey has lead from January to today. This community is genuinely on the cusp of greatness, I hope you can sense that. I'm not just talking about Gamestop poppin off. Although it does have the potential to enrich for generations... This is bigger than any of us that read these posts. Who would have thought we would all be so WRINKLY! And welcoming such a legendary ape as Dr. T! My heart just bursts with pride!

Having said that, I don't want to see any bullying of anyone around the sub -even if they are a blatantly criminal ex-hedgie having a breakdown on live tv- don't pick on people- and even if they're not real apes and pretending to be one! Be groovy or leave, man! ✌

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!
