Proxy Voting

Oook so lots of us are confused on how to vote, when to vote, and what to vote for. So let's remember what [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) said:

CONTACT YOUR BROKER, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU BASED ON YOUR EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!

It is extremely important that you aren't just taking advice on this from the subreddit, every broker has slightly different ways of doing things, and in this subreddit there are people from all over the world, using brokers with all sorts of different rules under all sorts of different legal systems. So I reiterate:

CONTACT YOUR BROKER

So, with that out of the way, we thought it may be important to touch on the process of voting again, this vote is incredibly important and could determine the future of GameStop as a company... Squeeze or no, it should be regarded as a priority for you to take the time to make your voice heard. You have invested time and money into this company and it would be a waste to not vote if you can.

Steps to Voting:

1.  HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER

Obtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.

2\. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).

Do not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.

3\. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.

Take a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.

4\. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.

5\. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.

Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible. Many speculate that there may be some short-seller-related fuckery with the votes given how badly they are likely hurting right now. With the untold number of borrowed shares and phantom shares flying around it certainly seems possible we may see a substantial number of over-votes (votes that exceed the total number of existing shares). It is unclear exactly how this will be handled if it does come to fruition, so it is best you vote the moment you are able.

_________________________________________________________________________________

🐈 BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! 🦧

Well, did you...

-   Check your broker inbox for proxy info✔

-   Check your email✔

-   Send a message via your broker help/chat interface✔

-   Call your broker and request your control number✔

-   Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search✔

-   Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info✔

Keep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to 2 weeks longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. 🤔

I can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website. I don't know what that means. I am still investigating why brokers seems to have their own landing page for proxy voting. Idk am not computer nerd, am just pink cat 🤷‍♀️

[Edit: More info from Euroapes trying to vote!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpqdf/europoors_what_needs_to_be_done_to_be_able_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[And a report from Degiro](https://www.reddit.com/r/DEGIRO/comments/n4kn6t/degiro_refuses_to_give_out_control_numbers_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

As with everything, the first step towards creating real change is to exercise your right to vote 💪

I voted!

📣📣Speaking of the importance of Proxy voting...📣📣

Do you apes wish you knew why we keep talking about voting?!

Do you wish you could ask someone what proxy voting is?!

DO YOU WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST COME AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE HELL ALL THIS MEANS?! Yes please dear God

You really loved having Queen Kong, Dr. T on our Superstonk Live YouTube. Now it's time for you to meet [~~your Swedish Grandpa~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/kkc6k5/my_swedish_grandpa_tried_lingonberry_g_fuel_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Mr. [Carl Hagberg.](https://optimizeronline.com/about/)

*"Mr. Hagberg is considered to be one of the nation's leading experts on individual stock ownership programs. He has helped over 100 companies (including companies and government agencies in several Eastern European and Central Asian countries) to launch, improve or remarket programs aimed at customers, employees, existing stockholders and other affinity groups.* *He is also considered to be a leading expert on the proxy voting process and has served as Independent Inspector of Election, both in contested and uncontested situations, at over 300 annual and special meetings of shareholders."*

Just like Dr. T and many of the others I first learned about, I first saw Carl while watching the MANDATORY DOCUMENTARY FOR ALL APES, [The Wall Street Conspiracy](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU). This documentary first made its rounds in the subs in early February during the bleeding red days, and it really helped me gain some perspective. I'm serious I will give you a 💩 flair if you don't watch this documentary. Watch it and learn of the apes that came before us.

[Upon Dr. T's recommendation, everyone needs to read this comment from Mr. Hagberg to the SEC regarding overvoting!🚨](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-725/4725-4611649-176367.pdf)

We are honored and thrilled to have Mr. Hagberg in time to discuss these issues before the annual meeting on 6/9 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Carl Hagberg, Proxy Expert and Secret Reddit Swedish Grandpa

Mr. Hagberg will be hosted by our very own ape [u/Atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/Atobitt/) on our Superstonk Live YouTube Wednesday, May 12, 2021 at 4pm EST! Details coming soon!

Dont Forget This Thursday: The US House Committee on Financial Services Hearing Date set for Thursday May 6, 2021 at 12:00 Eastern

Title: Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, Part III

The Financial Services committee announced they will be holding [Part 3 of their Gamestop hearings](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407748) this Thursday.

[![r/Superstonk - 📣Tuesday Superstonk Daily DD 05-04-2021 SURPRISE ANOTHER AMA ANNOUNCEMENT!!!📣 MAY THE 4TH BE WITH YOU APES!!! 🍌](https://preview.redd.it/t1w38gxrk1x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=97328e09b8cc2bb5cee47582b210783c70a2a7b4)](https://preview.redd.it/t1w38gxrk1x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=97328e09b8cc2bb5cee47582b210783c70a2a7b4)

That witness list 👀

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

They're watching 👀

I want everyone to feel safe and welcome in this sub. There is a lot of negativity out there and we mods try our best to shield this community from the unnatural amount of hate we receive as a whole. So while you may see the 250,000 members we have and think that's our entire community think again.

There are a lot more people watching us than you think.👀 Don't believe me? Take a look at these stats for the sub:

-   651,000 unique views in the last 24 hours

-   2.7 Million unique views in the last 7 days

-   48 Million page views in the last 7 days

-   2-3,000 new members every day

-   Superstonk Daily on the front page of Reddit 3 times last week, including a #2 spot on [r/All](https://www.reddit.com/r/All/)

Do you see those numbers? Those are NOT rookie numbers! And they are growing! Almost 3 million unique devices came and checked us out last week. Now do you believe me that there are *lots* of gorrillas in the mist?

༼ ºل͟º ༼ ºل͟º ༼ ºل͟º ༽ ºل͟º ༽ ºل͟º ༽

All of that to say, we are growing! And we always have room for more to learn and grow with us. Just remember that not everyone watching has good intentions and we needs to stay sharp. Remember the jungle is *full* of predators. Ignore the FUD and trust your gut (and the DD and fundamentals). Remember nothing here is advice. Except for this:

Don't gamble more than you can afford to lose. Make sure GME isn't your life plan. Eat as healthy as you can afford. Drink lots of water. Get a little sunshine every day. Hug your family, your pets, or your GME extra tight every day. And make love, not war. ✌💖🦄🐈

Be excellent to each other!!!

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.

This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
