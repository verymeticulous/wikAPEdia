Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

Be sure to vote with your shares, don't think it won't matter because it does, over-voting would show there are lots of things being wrong and would give the company a much needed excuse to call their votes back in.

Also for the 6/9 (nice) annual shareholders meeting, remember that we will most likely not see a lot happen to the stock immediately after this because if they have something planned (NFT/Dividend/ recounting their own shares etc) it can be mentioned there but could still take some time before it can be implemented.

Like the NFT is set to launch around the 14th of July, if they were to give a dividend it could also be a few weeks, a recount can take a lot longer though, due to the audit process being very specific it may take a month or maybe longer (I can't say, or imagine, how long auditing the shares would take as this is a scale because the situation unprecedented) and there is a chance the vote count can be doctored to make sure it shows a non accurate vote count, regardless of everything just hodl and wait, as news reports have already stated SHF have list close to 2 billion usd just from Monday till Wednesday, but also these are "paper" losses as there is only an actual loss once they close their positions.

Please go out and vote! there are only a few days left that you can, I believe the official cut off date is the 6th.

DTCC Notice - FICC - Requirements for Clearing Members Reset

The Mortgage-Backed Securities Division ("MBSD") of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC") will reset the CCLF® requirement for all Clearing Members that selected Option 1 or 2 on the Officers' Certificate. The reset will be effective as of July 1, 2021.

<https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/6/2/MBS988-21.pdf>

As [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) was kind enough to respond on a thread about this:

> Might not mean anything, these resets are standard every ~6 months. HOWEVER...
>
> The CCLF increased the liquidity requirement of members earlier this year. The funds help the FICC in the event of a member default. I believe the below post is much more interesting than this reset.

Volume difference

So I've seen some troll posts talking about how hodling doesn't work, I also found a thread by [u/GoochTainter](https://www.reddit.com/u/GoochTainter/) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqtcd8/hooolllly_fuck_look_at_the_volume_on_january/)

In January we had movement (volume) that reached into the millions but the past weeks volume has been fairly low in comparisson, How low you ask?

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-03-2021](https://preview.redd.it/okqp0nr5h0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=448549f1c56301309eecc93d5c05dbf8a2396f69)](https://preview.redd.it/okqp0nr5h0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=448549f1c56301309eecc93d5c05dbf8a2396f69)

Look at that, the price is almost at the squeeze levels of January with close to no volume, this is insane! this proves to me (personally) that we are correct about most of the DD we've seen, we've proven that the FTD cycles of both T+21 for regular shorts and T+35 for options are real, we've seen them push other stocks (silver, amc, BB, nok) on MSM while completely ignoring GME and only making posts "15 stocks to make you forget GME" and we've found that our tits are indeed, Jaqued.

If you own one of those other stocks, awesome I'm genuinely happy for you guys, but remember this is a GME sub, so lets keep those stocks to a minimum, again if you have a correlation between them it's ok to post it here, or a theory how they all connect etc, but not oh look at my XXX stock, the first one is helping, the latter is seen as a distraction.

Gamestop confirms release of Q1 results and meeting date

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-03-2021](https://preview.redd.it/y9r27ej8i0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6d963fd40936a4563f7c8e2281b20a818f8ab2)](https://preview.redd.it/y9r27ej8i0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6d963fd40936a4563f7c8e2281b20a818f8ab2)

Now this is a fun one so let's go over this because there is a lot of information in this even if it looks fairly plain from first glance.

First all the date, 6/9 is the date they also released their Q1 numbers in 2020, so they are keeping the same schedule ( I've seen post saying this is earlier than normal but it seems to be the exact date like last time).

Last years Q1:<https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results>

After this call all the information released by GME HQ will be available on their website

They will host an Investor conference call at 5 PM ET the same day to review the companies financials.

The phone number for investor conference call is 877-451-6152 Code to enter is 13720011

The annual shareholders meeting will be held at 6/9 11 AM ET and will only last 15 minutes

George Sherman will be attending the physical meeting and the other directors will be there via zoom/skype etc.

Now what does this all tell us?

They have a seperate call for the Q1 earnings report (look back at the Q4 call that lasted 20 minutes with sherman phoning it in), this will focus on the direct financial side of things, meaning their actual earnings (duh).

The Annual shareholders meeting however is a different beast entirely, with this one we can hear a lot of things coming, we can hear the roadmap the company is going to use in the coming years, we can hear how the board will be placed, who will become the new CEO but also one thing that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

The Share count, at most we will hear a preliminary counting, because if our theory about the huge amount of phantom shares is true (yes until confirmed by the company its still a theory and yes these numbers can be fucked with before it even gets to the company), the cut off date for counting is the 6th of June, meaning if they get millions more it will take some time to get through this.

HOWEVER, this is also a good thing, if they can see from preliminary numbers that the sharecount is out of wack, they can get an Auditor, just to make sure the shares are correct.

Also keep in mind we may not hear everything we want to hear at the shareholders meeting because after this meeting GME will be more "free" to discuss which direction they want to go into and the "silent" period for the company may be over.

Remember my Favorite book series?

[![r/Superstonk - The Daily Stonk 06-03-2021](https://preview.redd.it/gnrd8lo3l0371.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b54ec77d30baa123ef78e87da1226e7810366f4)](https://preview.redd.it/gnrd8lo3l0371.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b54ec77d30baa123ef78e87da1226e7810366f4)

Expect it, just saying, I'm constantly waiting to get a rug pull as a last sort of hail mary, but the awesome part is that I can see in the posts that I'm far from the only one and I've seen a lot of people discussing "what could they do next?" which is awesome because last time we foresaw them pulling the rug at 300 and everyones reaction was just "oh... ok, so hodl?"

No one panics if everything goes to plan - weird clown guy

Also Yes I realise the news is fairly... "short" today, I expect it to become less and less as we get nearer to the shareholders meeting, this because well the company wont say shit now they'd rather bring it to the table on the annual shareholder meeting right?

So the only things I'd be able to get is information from the DTC/DTCC/FINRA/FINTEL/ and Data provided by awesome members we have here and outside of the sub. so don't worry we're just in a period that's called a "silent period" which a company usually has before meetings like this.

We don't know what the annual shareholders meeting will bring, but I'm excited as all hell.

(also little side note, keep in mind we wont see shit happen on the Annual shareholder meeting because its after market close, we'll see the affects of it in the days/weeks after it 😉)

So stay classy, stay Jaqued!

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
