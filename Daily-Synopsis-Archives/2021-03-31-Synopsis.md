Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Kenny phone call, line one!

*insert flashy intro card*

Ok that was wild

Ok so for the people who missed the debacle yesterday let me recap it here real quickly.

Yesterday a good DD got posted, in that DD was a link to a pdf, the pdf was fine, the problem however lied with the website that the pdf was hosted on.

This website had some extreme political views, and because of that we don't allow it.

the mod team consists of people from all walks of life, and we try to respect everyone from every aspect. one of the ways we do that is making sure we don't support any form of discrimination, sexism or misogyny.

Everyone is welcome here, but people this is a sub about a specific stock, not politics or gender issues, so please keep to the stock.

The most important thing about this entire ordeal is that we learn to respect everyone, this is one of the many reasons why I've been trying to preach "apes don't fight apes". Because united we stand divided we fall.

that's why we won't accept any posts or threads that may in some way shape or form divide us.

Also if you think "so what it's about the pdf not the website its on right?" you'd be partially right but you need to think of the bigger picture, because right now how would it look if this goes on and a news site does an article about us (or another sub for that matter) can you imagine the headlines?\
"Dumb money associated with extremist website".

So please realize that this is something small that can turn into a big problem later down the road, we try to walk a fine line between allowing everything that's ok and not censor people and having a healthy sub which they wont take down.

The same thing goes for the new hires of GME, yes they are amazing but reaching out to them and fanboying is not going to help us, making threads objectifying them even less so. so for the love of god guys have a sense of decorum.

Now onto the news.

April 2nd

On april 2nd (this friday) the stock market will be closed, this is because of good friday.

Truffle shuffle

Today will mark the end of the first quarter, meaning that Hedgies will have to respond and show their books both long and short It's simple, shorts need the price as low as possible, trying to hide short interest, or FTD, or any of that shit is irrelevant today. and juxtaposed with that is for the long positions, they need the price to be as high as possible.

Also I've heard that today an hour before close the ETF's are rebalancing, meaning we could see something happen, I'm not saying liftof, I'm saying it will be interesting.

Remember we don't do dates, and the hedgies will try to lie as much and as hard as possible to get their tendies, they'll lie, cheat and scam their way to their fourth yacht.

So keep your expectations tempered about this.

and it's short

The naked shorting scam revealed.

Ok so onto the naked sections

[This was the good DD from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) The bad link has been since removed, now I know what a lot of you are thinking "But Ren, those rules are old" and you'd be a 100% correct, the thing that's interesting to me is not that the rules have changed since then, but more the methodology used.

Kenny started learning in the 80's and made his company in 1990, this means that the tricks he most likely knows are the old school ones, and those are the ones we are seeing today, can't teach an old dog new tricks right?

Well the DD in itself is good but we need a few wrinkle brains to look into this, because if that one checks out it would work really well with [this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/) DD and and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/) one.

I think that we may have found Achilles' heel

This would in turn work well together with low availability of shares, the big FTD numbers, the glitches in TOS and the max pain theory.

Max payne? no not the videogame idiot max pain is the sweet spot in the middle of the puts and calls, this means if we stay in a sweet spot where they expire worthless, we help Kenny dig his own financial grave.

Because if you look at all the puts, calls and options there are a lot very low and a lot very high, but in the middle there aren't a lot of them. so that's the point where the stock uses "max pain" and this dries the hedgefunds bit by bit. and this is why patience is key, we can stay retarded longer then they can remain solvent.

now this also means that the well has to dry slowly for this to work right?

well thank you [u/33a](https://www.reddit.com/u/33a/) as he did a chart of the available to borrow shares.

Now remember these are numbers from Iborrowdesk and these don't account for all of them but it does give a good indicator as to what's happening

| rank | ticker | Available | Fee | Float | Available/float |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TKAT | 1000 | 543.60% | 5.97M | 0.0168% |
| 2 | DLPN | 100000 | 95.00% | 4.87M | 2.05% |
| 3 | GME | 6000 | 0.8% | 54.2M | 0.0111% |
| 4 | SPRT | 950000 | 20% | 15.2M | 6.25% |
| 5 | HOFV | 750000 | 21.8% | 45.5M | 1.65% |
| 6 | BNTC | 60000 | 107.4% | 3.98M | 1.51% |
| 7 | WKEY | 100000 | 54% | 6.35M | 1.57% |
| 8 | WAFU | 15000 | 108.2% | 1.18M | 1.27% |
| 9 | APOP | 85000 | 107.4% | 3.57M | 2.38% |
| 10 | RIOT | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 11 | YVR | 350000 | 43.1% | 8.61M | 4.07% |
| 12 | APTO | 500000 | 8% | 84.8M | 0.59% |
| 13 | ZKIN | 55000 | 25.8% | 11.3M | 0.488% |
| 14 | KOSS | 75000 | 92.1% | 1.56M | 4.81% |
| 15 | IMMP | 550000 | 66.6% | 61.5M | 0.895% |

This is insane. Not only does GME have by far the fewest number of shares to borrow, but the fee is almost nothing. It's hard to get a sense of how far out of whack GME is with the rest of the universe from numbers, so HE made a chart to help visualize the gap:

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 03-31-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/508u2rxb2cq61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=13617b452c760480f64c584cb50c15eceec6bc89)](https://preview.redd.it/508u2rxb2cq61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=13617b452c760480f64c584cb50c15eceec6bc89)

On the X-axis, we have the normalized available shares, which is available shares to borrow / float. On the y-axis we can see the borrow fee. I had to make this LOG SCALE in order to be able to even see anything due to how distorted the numbers are with GME. There is a general trend that as the available borrow shares goes down, you see borrow fees go up (though some stocks have generally more shares and may be more liquid, affecting these numbers). We can see that TKAT's borrow fee is quite high at 543%, given that there are almost no shares available to borrow right now.

*But LOOK AT GME!* GME has even fewer shares available as a percentage of its float (they even ran out last week), and yet the borrow rate is almost 0. This is so out of whack that clearly something crazy is going on. I consider this strong evidence of some kind of collusion between the banks lending shares to manipulate the borrow fees for GME. There is no way that the fee should be so low.

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.
