Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Can someone go check on Ken? I kindof want my sundae...

First of all as always none of this is financial advice, just an idiot with a win 95 terminal writing shit.

Q4 Earnings report.

Ok so I've been getting a lot of messages regarding what I expect of the Q4 earnings report.

A few things to keep in mind for this:

Due to the pandemic a lot more people have been staying inside and gaming more than usual.

Nintendo reported to have had a record breaking sales year [seen here](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)

RC only stated his investment of GME around November and only stepped into a official capacity in January (Jan 10th as I believe).

So the true echo of this entire thing will be noticeable in the Q1 Earnings report, even so I expect the Q4 Earnings to be positive, but by looking at everything going on I believe that we wont see the true extent until the Q1 and Q2 2021 earnings reports.

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 03-22-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/mcmiddl7sjo61.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9c4f6bcea3b3681019fb33f00df82fdde0c4f2)](https://preview.redd.it/mcmiddl7sjo61.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9c4f6bcea3b3681019fb33f00df82fdde0c4f2)

Wen Ceo?

Ok so what I have noticed is that usually (again purely from what I've seen) A new CEO will be appointed after the Quarterly earnings report, if RC won't be called in as CEO directly, relax it's not always a direct line, right now he is focusing on making the inside of GME healthy again.

And that means he can become CEO in the next week, but it may just as well be within the next six months, for example he can do it by June with the international shareholder meeting.

Remember we have no clock, there is no sense of urgency.

it will come when it comes

Also going by the information [of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mafvpz/jim_bell_was_not_the_only/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it seems that the board(george Sherman) and 3 of his cronies (Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez and Kathy Vrabeck) tried to keep Cohen out, why? well if they where in cahoots with Melvin or Citadel then it would be in their best interest to keep Ryan and his new team out as much as they can.

Funny enough on all their slips (seen in the screenshots in that post) Jim Bell (now EX CFO) was the lawyer for all three of these people.

Fuckery, is afoot.

Sup Melvin

To Squeeze or not to Squeeze,

Ok so this is the most found Fud I've seem to come across so let's nip this in the butt as much as we can.

"GmE WoNt SqUeZe GeT 0Ut"

Bullshit, listen at this point it's easy, it doesn't matter if it squeezes or not, if you look at how GME is transforming itself right now it is still a solid investment in my opinion as the company's worth is not yet reflected in it's price.

How am I so sure? as this stock is currently still very manipulated and it's still at around the 200 mark, so I see this stock on it's own (sans squeeze) hover between the 500 to 1000 mark (depending on how well they transform the company, but with RC at the helm I see this going to a 1000 minimum).

"We OwN ThE Fl0aT"

We dont, not yet.

If we owned the entire float it would be impossible for us to buy any shares.

So if you look at the fact that we can still buy them, I know because I was able to get 10 more on friday, it means there is still float available.

"BuT ThEy ArE SyNtHetic"

Don't mean shit, if you bought them, they're yours, it's your bank/broker/dealer (sup Tyrone) job to give you real ones, if they end up being synthetic (which in and of themselves would be weird as melvin and shitadel need those for shorting) then you can still sell them later on for the same worth as the real ones.

The Fuddering

Alright let's post some funny stuff people have found over the weekend, related to fud, Vlad the stock Impaler's company.

Addendum: <https://www.upwork.com/job/Redditor-looking-for-someone-post-Reddit_~01397c3ee182712312/>

Not sure if real or not but seems like something they'd do, as remember they have everything to lose, if I was in their position I would do everything I could.

Because if they can FUD out enough people they may be able to survive, and the fines they receive are a slap on the wrist at worst. remember they view fines just as "the cost of doing business".

Be sure to register beforehand, because we will most likely "force choke" their ISP by just wanting to be informed. Seriously GME I'm already sorry for the amount of internet traffic this will get.

if you can't connect to it don't worry I'll be tuning in and I will be taking notes throughout.

The Yearly Shareholders meeting.

So a smart ape [u/zakataha](https://www.reddit.com/u/zakataha/) found this:

2021

So this may also be why we have not yet seen a recall on GME's end. Due to Texas law you can at max ask for 60 days before the meeting for the shares to be recalled. so at the earliest expect mid April for this.

The thing is that we've also read that Blackrock has a big portion but didn't recall their shares as they didn't care enough to vote, but this was a previous year and it was a very different scenario. due to everything happening it could be that GME themselves recall the shares due to expectation of fraud.

Addendum: I've also read some people post "oh but they outweigh RC so he wont get voted in", to those people I'd like to say, WELCOME TO CORPERATE LIFE!

He can get either voted in (which is very likely Imo) OR he could just buy more shares and do a hostile takeover, one way or another, if he man wants that seat he'll get it as he's got the money to do a Hostile takeover but I think giving the current BOD this shouldn't be a problem.

Also (please prove me wrong with this) I've been looking into the current CEO George Sherman, and I've not seen him post, or offer any comments on the current situation what so ever, which is weird to say the least.

Now being in a publicly traded company does bring along certain limits, you can't just say what you want against short sellers, because people know it could hurt their company, so they'd rather keep their head down and go through the storm.

Fuddruckers?

Now it has been quiet in the past weekend to my knowledge, I've been offline for 99% of the time but still. it seems that they're trying what I speculated last week and the week before.

Get the members who are doing their best to help the community and either get them banned or get them discredited.

[Welp here we go](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/maikv1/after_my_ban_was_revoked_hedgies_are_trying_to/)

I'm not saying that the people who are doing this are bot's shills or trolls, I'm just saying stay vigilant against all forms of FUD.

People have noticed that both RC and DFV are following Elon, this may be because of a simple reason, he's a funny guy? also Elon has expressed interest in adding gaming in his cars for quite some while now (I believe this originated at around 2018/2019).

But what's interesting is this:

<https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop>

It could be that Tesla is going to add in some form of gaming in their cars, and given the fact that GME is currently actively looking to extend their business in all different types and forms, so this does not confirm anything, it's just nice to see the link and who knows, we may see a tesla with built in gaming rigs for long drives or charging sessions.

Most of you are helping Citadel without knowing it.

As stated in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mai4pe/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/) there are a lot of people helping Citadel without knowing it.Check your broker in that post, check your settings and be sure to set everything correctly.

We have also seen a lot of post stating that if you use OPTIONS, there is a huge chance that you're helping the other side, because who writes these options? and who do they work with?

DFV has spoken

Ok for the people who don't know this here is Michael Jacksin, the KING of POP!

the songs he performed there:

-   "Jam" (includes beginning of "Why You Wanna Trip On Me")

-   "Billie Jean"

-   "Black or White"

-   "We Are the World" (children's choir)

-   "Heal the World"

Interesting thing about MJ, this was his glove:

ETF's

So as some people may have known, last friday the ETF's rebalanced, this means that the stocks they have inside of them changed. now I have not seen how many ETF's have dropped GME or how many have held on, if anyone has any type of analysis on this subject please let me know.

Now the most important part of everything

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

Someone was awesome enough to map the ETF's new amount of GME in etf's.

it seems that currently there are 15,846,731 shares stuck in the ETF's.

Edit 2:

Because some people can't properly read let me state it here, the fact that I Think GME is a good company regardless of a squeeze DOES NOT MEAN I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN THE SQUEEZE!.

!!!I STILL BELIEVE THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN!!!

I believe a squeeze is inevitable at this point, but looking at the fundamentals it's a good company.

it's also currently very undervalued in my opinion

not financial advice.

Edit 3:

Also what I might want to add is that it may be a good idea to contact your brokers, and ask them to recall your shares and tell them not to lend them out until you want them to.
