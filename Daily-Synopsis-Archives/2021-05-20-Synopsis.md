Goodmorning Superstonk

Surprise! Me again, [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) !

I offered to take over the writing of the daily for today to give my friends [u/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://www.reddit.com/u/PinkCatsOnAcid/) and [u/Rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rensole/) a bit more time off, they work so hard on these I thought it was the least I could do! So without further *adieu...* let's get on to the news!

New host who dis?

So some of you are probably thinking "*OMG, B_T went rouge and took over the news*"

Well, I am here to tell you that that is false!

I figured I would give them some extra time off, and since I am usually helping out with these anyway, it's about time I take a swing at writing one, assuming that's alright with everyone!

Crypt-oh-no / ICC-2021-007 - [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)

<https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-10498.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&utm_source=federalregister.gov>

It seems that something was up (or rather down?) In the crypto markets! There were some that were speculating that it could be in preparation for the increased margin requirement that the new ICC-2021-007 set forth.

Pretty cool if this were correct

That having been said, I have seen some speculation that this could have been linked somehow to the DTCC liquidity test that we saw recently. Hard to say what their intentions with this rule were.

Glacier Capital (wtf) - [u/sharkbaitlol](https://www.reddit.com/u/sharkbaitlol/)

Hey all, just helping the team out to write a quick opinion piece on the entire Glacier Capital fiasco that has swept the front page; as we have seen these posts seem to have attracted an abnormal amount of awards (specifically the all-seeing).

<https://preview.redd.it/s3c31gbxpzz61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49a7d617d65caf7716b73ca65512884c3900596>

Here's the kicker (correct me if I'm wrong); I cannot find a single piece of information from the SEC or the Luxemburg filings that confirms them actually buying into GME. Just a seeking alpha article which seems to be what everyone is referencing.

*in places like Luxembourg or Cyprus you can literally buy a shell company that's existed for quite some time from the legal offices there. Complete with a board of directors. These people can be complete and total randoms off the street. This is what I suspect is happening here. Scary thing is it's not a really expensive thing to do so; most people will accept under 10k euro to put down their signature.*

There's a great series on this topic called "This Giant Beast That is the Global Economy" on Prime Video, the very first episode actually goes into this phenomenon in detail. The TLDR; is that you can go to a law office, buy a made-up company, launder money.

--------------------------------------------

Now doing a search directly on the Luxemburg commerce registry since I can't find anything really related from the SEC; I'm finding very different info than what users have pointed out --- there are alternative addresses on pretty much every filing they have. Funny thing is that these addressed are mostly registered to residential areas. This would coincide with common tax evasion tactics

[https://www.lbr.lu/](https://preview.redd.it/6b3cnppjpzz61.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6831f37666f524c976e65e8d55d8029c994031b)

Here is the registered office (44 Boulevard de Verdun)

[Glacier Capital Registered Office;](https://preview.redd.it/wlkgnpyepzz61.png?width=1748&format=png&auto=webp&s=99117c4a0382616341c221c98761d5ba373aa992)

Now my French isn't too bad here in Canada; so I tried my best navigating this filing from the Luxemburg commerce registry and found the following; we can confirm the involvement of Marc-Francois Daubenfeld as well as the value of their assets.

<https://preview.redd.it/d22nto7eozz61.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fcc15dcbc3fe0ac16d0c84f3a916b65b9c3cb9a>

<https://preview.redd.it/vmu6sd1nozz61.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2ab01856c571c651739a6e636bc6c32e1bd586>

The above screenshot is for their activity from 2018 (as that's the most recent thing filed). So we understand that in a few short years they went from managing a couple hundred thousand euros to almost 100 million if I'm reading this correctly.

I want to point out that Mr. Daubenfeld is a "lawyer that turned fund manager", remember what I mentioned about this being law offices specifically selling fake shell companies?

<https://preview.redd.it/rg0lop7ctzz61.png?width=204&format=png&auto=webp&s=88375ecd75121949bdbd07368421c098f8621bc1>

Now why this is being pushed up so much, I have no idea. Can anyone even find confirmation they own GME ie a bb terminal screenshot? I couldn't tell you if this has some sort of malicious intent or not. Tread lightly on this one apes.

Sometimes I cannot tell if I am a madman or he is a genius... or both. One thing I do know is that there is no way Ryan Cohen isn't leaving us breadcrumbs, at least in my opinion. So what might you ask could be the meaning of this tweet? I hadn't a clue, but these great apes seemed to be onto something:

Less than three weeks? Damn Ryan, I am going to break out my "Days 'til Christmas" countdown calendar for this, you got me so excited!

Today we are receiving multiple reports that GameStop has made their site available to more of our international Apes, congrats!! Also, this is super bullish, to me this is just more proof of how large-scale their e-commerce platform is going to be. I can only imagine the kinds of exciting announcements they have on the horizon

TL:DR This rule allows broader participation in any auctions of "Suspended Clearing members", including but not limited to "Non-clearing members". Essentially it will be easier for Blackrock to pick clean the carcass of Citadel when their greed and misconduct catch up to them.

For a fairly straightforward, and rather in-depth look at this rule, check out this post from a month ago when it was first filed:

Well Jpow says the market is fine so I am sure there is nothing nefarious going on... /s

We can only speculate if this is related to GME... but I will say there is likely a lot to whistleblow about with all the stuff going on 👀

Single most important piece of the puzzle. If you don't vote, then you aren't doing right by yourself or GameStop

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others! As always, we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo. We help each other, we care for each other.

Most importantly:

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.
