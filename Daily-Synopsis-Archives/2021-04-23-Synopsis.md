Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Do you smell that?

*insert flashy intro card*

Ok who pushed the entire market down a cliff? Bobby was it you?

so yesterday the entire market seem to tank around midday, as far as the news went the official reason is because the USA president Biden has upped the federal gains tax to about 43%

Now would this logically speaking have an effect on the market? yes of course.

Could it be that because SEC rule 15c3-3 went into effect? yes totally.

it could be a combination of both of these things which can tank an entire market, namely the announcement being Why, and the Sec rule the how.

as the new Sec rule means that they need more collateral for their positions, they may have needed to sell off big chunks in order to meet that requirement.

What was also weird yesterday is that suddenly a lot of crypto got pumped into the high heavens, this is a theory we have seen since early February that they would pump crypto to make lots off gains there, or use it as a safe haven for their money in case of the company going bust.

At this point it's too early to tell why, but it's good to keep an eye on it.

One thing that has caught my eye as well is the sudden "surge" of interest in user "ratioblessings", I've often told them over at [r/gme](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/) that they are trying to give off the air of being an insider but a few things to keep in mind.

A) if they are one they stand to gain millions by whistleblowing

B) they would give out answers, not do an interactive puzzle hunt

C) how to keep people busy with "busywork" and base everything off of conjecture and special "emoji's" because those emoji's mean something.

So ffs please chill guys, I know you guys want an insider to come help us, but the chances of us actually seeing an actual insider here are slim to none.

YOU GET A PROXY, AND YOU GET A PROXY EVERYONE GETS A PROXY

Ok so yesterday ya boi GME released their proxy statements and oof let's go through them for a bit as there is a lot to unpack.

Form 14A:

<https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18846/html>

Supplemental proxy material (incl how to vote):

<https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18841/html>

Ok first of all lets take a look at the big one (and one of the questions I've seen the most here), it's now set in stone that the annual shareholders meeting is on 6/9

it said that you need to be a shareholder by the 15th of April.

Does this mean the shares needed to be recalled by the 15th of April? No.

This means that you need to have bought your shares before the 15th to be able to vote, the shares can be recalled until 10 days before the meeting, meaning at the latest we'll see the institutions recall their shares up to 29th of May (t+2).

So putting this next to the Iborrowdesk site's info on the cost % of last year and knowing this it's fair to make the conclusion that they have not yet started the recall, but will start doing so in the next few weeks if they want to do so, and I believe they do.

Total float

We also learned from them directly that the available float is only about 26.7 million.

Institutional ownership

What we also learned is the total of institutional ownership which is up to date (at least I believe so) and they own ‭33.333.438‬ (‭58,5‬%)

This however does not include the amount of shares held by institutions bellow the 5% reporting threshold.

Director ownership (insider owners)

We learned the total shares on the inside is 11,674,085 (16.5%)

This means that 75% of the total shares are locked up or ‭45.008.523‬ shares in total.

Meaning that 26.7 is the float (give or take).

(fun fact DFV owns roughly over 1.25% of that publicly available float)

Ever leveled a character to max stats? Rc did

Now they brought in an external party to overview who would be best placed where, and who would be the best at certain positions.

What did caught my eye was page 47 and page 48.

```
Page 47
Actual and Expected Executive Separations
In the case of Messrs. Homeister and Sherman,
the table below presents an updated estimate of their expected severance
rights, with stock values based on the closing price of our common stock
on April 15, 2021 ($156.44). This is supplemental information and
is provided to give more current estimates of these executives' severance
rights in light of their impending departures based on updated stock
prices, updated share amounts and,
in the case of Mr. Sherman, revised severance terms.

```

```
Page 48.
The amount shown in the table represents the value of 812,703 shares of
time-vested restricted stock that are expected to vest on an accelerated
basis in connection with Mr. Sherman's departure, based on the closing
price of our common stock on April 15, 2021 ($156.44).
This does not include 308,477 shares of time-vested restricted stock
that are expected to vest in the ordinary course on June 9, 2021,
prior to the presently expected date of Mr. Sherman's departure.

```

That last sentence, "THE EXPECTED DATE OF MR. SHERMAN'S DEPARTURE". aka the board still wants him gone. ofcourse mr Sherman brings with him years of experience with brick and mortar stores but I believe he may still be on the way out and this is his hail mary, I know that if I had a vote I would not keep someone who failed for years in a ceo position.

I'm sure there is way more to unpack in these documents but this is what I was able to find so far.

Unfortunately I have to end on some bad news, I've been doing these posts for months now, day in day out, often resulting in workdays of 10 to 15 hours a day. and at this point it has began taking its toll on me.

I'm just tired guys, I'm so fucking tired.

Checking everything, making dailies, moderating everything has asked a serious amount of me, I've started neglecting a lot of parts of my life and the most important people to me. And now a time has come where I have to take care of my own own personal mental and physical health.

So where to from here?

I will be taking a break, I'm not sure for how long, this could be a few days, a week or maybe longer.

I will still be on the moderator team but I will be in a more "background" role advising and helping the team whenever and wherever I can, and I'm thankful that the entire mod team has my back in this and being super supportive.

Will the dailies be over? Nope!

I had a good talk with the team and two mods will be taking over for me.

Our very own [u/Bye_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) as Brick Tamland, and [u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/) as our Veronica Corningstone. they will be filing in for me as I rest up. how they do so is fully up to them.

If I can leave you with some advice for when I'm wrong it would be this:

Avoid tin foil, even if it looks tempting.

Think critically about everything, this includes your own opinion, be open to the idea of being wrong with something, this leaves room to learn and change what you believe.

Always question everything, always.

Don't kneejerk react, if you see something take a step back, reflect on it and then come back, rule your emotions before they rule you. and decisions made on emotions are often hard to come back from.

And plan your exit strategy

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.
