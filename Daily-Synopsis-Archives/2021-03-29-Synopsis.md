Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Is anyone gonna pick up that call?

*insert flashy intro card*

We salute you Pixel,

As most of you know, some DD makers had a lot of hate going their way.

Now Pixel, regardless if his predictions where right or not, should not have gotten this amount of hate and threats. because Pixel now fears for his and his families safety he wont be posting here any time soon. you will be missed dude.

April fools

So this week we will have April fools coming up.

Let it be known that April fools has no place on this board, because people would have trouble seeing the difference between jokes and shills we will be taking a blanket statement against it.

April fools jokes = permaban

because we already have enough shills add to the "lol I sold" crap, we don't need more. So just to be safe, this wont be something we will tolerate.

Domo AMA

So after the successful AMA with Dennis Kelleher we will now have an AMA with Domo on 4/20 at 4:20 pm, they picked the data and I fucking love it.

We will update when we get closer to it.

Hey Call me maybe.

So the last Friday we saw some huge block trades take place.

```
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades
on Friday, part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion
from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants
to U.S. media conglomerates.

```

we dont know as of right now what caused this, what we do know is who, Tiger Cub Archegos Capital Management LLC .

Archegos is a hedgefund, it could be that they where over leveraged and got margin called, but because we don't have access to their books this remains speculation. we also don't know for sure if this had anything to do with GME, this may also be as of a result of the Suez Canal being blocked.

We just don't know right now.

This statement however does give me food for thought as this can mean some more stuff like this can happen but it could be just their MO that they decline comments on things like this.

Some more details on who Archegos are, and whats going on I'd say check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mesrdk/archegos_capital_is_a_hedge_fund_that_is/) by [u/electricp0ww0w](https://www.reddit.com/u/electricp0ww0w/) it goes into some detail on who they are and what may be up.

[and another one on why hedge funds may be getting Margin called and why this is just the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf5w2e/i_will_try_to_explain_why_hedge_funds_are_getting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Shitadel hiring freeze.

As [u/worried-yogurt-4204](https://www.reddit.com/u/worried-yogurt-4204/) wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/meoqgw/citadel_headed_toward_hiring_freeze_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Citadel is apparently in the midst of a hiring freeze.

Tldr of it is simple, Citadel has the highest turnover rate of all the major hedgefunds, this is not a big thing in and of itself because these companies are brutal, you either make the cut or you don't no second chances etc.

but they are terminated almost a full year before their competitors which is high, plus taking into account that citadel hires are normally of a cyclical nature (hires in June, and terminations look to be around August) but this year it seems to be different, for the first time in years they currently aren't hiring.

If they where still a healthy company they would be hiring, they would be looking at the future and thinking to themselves, we need people for the next season.

Also Kenny gave an interview to the Financial Times [here](https://archive.is/0AdPT)

This is showing me that he wants to create a narrative in which retail and "stimmy inflation" is to be blamed for the inevitable crash caused by them.

even going as far as to say (and I quote)

"Griffin highlighted how an oblique [tweet of a McDonald's ice cream cone](https://archive.is/o/0AdPT/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-idUSKBN2AO2SP) and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock's price in one afternoon in February."

and he took it financially

Increase in "endgame DD"

People I get it, you're excited for the endgame, but want to know a little secret?

We wont know when the endgame is until it is over. we can keep saying "oh its endgame now" or it's in a week or a month.

We don't know what the price ends up being, we don't know what the timeframe will be. it can be today tomorrow or a month from now, all we know is that at some point the bubble goes pop. we don't know when or where.

Si is upwards of 2000% ?

ok take this one with a hug ass canon of salt, the guy did a great job of writing it up but seeing we are constantly being fed bad data, this means that any research coming from this may be skewed, the SI could be more, it could be less.

Regardless I think it should be looked at.

Even this stock is a Beta

Seems like Kenny is rubbing it off on the stocks

[![r/GME - Synopsis for 03-29-2021 what we need to know before the market opens DD](https://preview.redd.it/vergti0wqxp61.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c85548f3c704763405e3c7caddb67f5e3d2b52e)](https://preview.redd.it/vergti0wqxp61.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c85548f3c704763405e3c7caddb67f5e3d2b52e)

it seems that the current GME Beta is at -23.73

Big numbers in TOS

ok so first of all check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/)

the post goes into:

1.  Why we see huge "volume" pop up on TD TOS for GME

2.  Why we see huge "volume" pop up on TD TOS for other stocks

3.  Why we see it in the "volume" column with no buy/sell orders lodged against it

4.  Why this "volume" can't be used to calculate short interest, potential prices or whatever other

Things to keep in mind

Right now this entire thing is just psychological, and you may think to yourself ok.. what?

let me explain, we have seen people say,

- They control the price

Lol no this is spiraling more and more out of control

- They can do anything

At some point they'll have to pay the piper

- We own the float

Smart way to get people to stop buying, we stop buying then the buying pressure falls, meaning they can short it back down and done. remember they where never planning on covering their shorts, the only way they can win is if this GME=0 and this is impossible now

- This is taking to long

People... seriously have you never worked for something? it takes time patience and effort to change things, this shit wont come overnight and it wont come easy.

So for the love of god chill the fuck out, you see some low level fud, ignore it.

you see someone who wants to rattle you, just think why would he?

If you see someone say "I think it will go max $500" let them think that, why ? because if you believe the price will go to 1k, or 100k, you wait till that point. if someone else doesn't agree on price with you it can be for a variety of reasons, but the main one is simple, why do you care when someone else values their stock in a different way? and why should you? I don't

And some of you don't know our buy Herbert Sukenik, give this a [read](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf6hqp/herbert_sukenik_the_greatest_diamond_hands_of_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Patience, is, EVERYTHING

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

Edit 1:

So the more often I see these things about options the more this makes my head hurt, this is something that has been discussed before time and time again.

<https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mexlpn/accidentally_released_and_incredibly_embarrassing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share>

it seems that there is a possibility that shorts can be hidden in far out OTM calls, now I can't and wont tell you what to do, but if you use option please be aware you may be helping hedgies.

I don't have the in depth technical knowledge to either say this is a 100% accurate or false, but I hope some smarter people will look into this.

Edit 2:

GameStop interview tomorrow
