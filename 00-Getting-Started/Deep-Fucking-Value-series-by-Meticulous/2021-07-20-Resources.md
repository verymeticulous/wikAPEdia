0\. Preface

This is a follow up to [u/Truffluscious](https://www.reddit.com/u/Truffluscious/)'s resources page.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, nor am I a financial advisor. I just have OCD and like to organize things.

1\. Overview

Since January, I have been saving, bookmarking, and archiving important GME content and relevant information on [Github](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia#readme) to both organize what I've learned and read, and create a backup in case the internet breaks.

Below is a list of websites, tools, and resources that have been used to create DD and other GME-content.

If I am missing any useful or relevant tools, please share them so that I can update this post and [wikAPEdia](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia#readme) for new and curious apes in the future.

Also, if I missed giving credit to the creators of these tools, please let me know as well!

Hope this helps!
