Apety apety apes. What's the difference between GME and my wife? GME doesn't fuck the mailman. Though my wife is a legal midget, GME is still wayyyyyyyyyyy more shorted than she is. Alright, enough about me. As always, remember to see my previous posts about the FTD cycle theory or you will be more confused than I am when my wife ISNT cheating on me. Also, I hope you apes like my new avatar. Like everything else I do, my goal was to make it as abusrd and strange as possible.

So today's post is just gonna be a quick update on what's happening with GME and the FTD Cycle and obviously a meme drop. My plan is to give big updates when something major happens or when I do new research and then smaller updates like these whenever I see necessary of when I get bored.

Today

Overall, today was a pretty good day. We were up slightly on lower volume but not as low as it has been in recent weeks. We almost hit $200 in the post-market yesterday and I would've liked to see us hit that again today but you cant have everything. Let's take positive days when they're given to us. Here's a day view of the FTD cycle theory.

[![r/Superstonk - Quick update from Hank - FTD Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/n8f0titsasv61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=d798d43f4e56dd1d6c9a8cc3f5210dca94148443)](https://preview.redd.it/n8f0titsasv61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=d798d43f4e56dd1d6c9a8cc3f5210dca94148443)

Just want to reemphasize a point that someone made yesterday. When I used a log scale and noted that the FTD Cycle period was increasing linearly, I failed to realize that a linear increase on a logarithmic scale is exponential on a regular scale. This makes complete and total sense because less than a year ago when this started we were trading below $30 and never got near $50 until early January, so the idea that the pattern is exponential seems to make sense. This means that as time goes on, the price should increase rapidly until it's too late. Again, I don't believe that anyone will see it coming when we finally moon, so don't try to predict that. Yes, it's possible to guess when we will see increases, but I don't think it's possible nor beneficial to try to predict when we moon. Finally, I just want to reemphasize the idea that the point of this theory is that it gets more expensive for shorts to continue this game every cycle and that pain seems to be increasing exponentially.

For the past few days, I've been saying that technicals don't really apply to GME because of the manipulation. I still believe that. However, I have zero self-control. SO I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT WE RESPECTED THAT SEXY UPPER LINE OF THE TRIANGLE AS SUPPORT TODAY OHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSS DADDY.

Moreover, I am pretty surprised at the low volume that we've seen so far. The price has definitely been in line with what the theory suggests but volume is still not there. Looking at the chart, it appears that GME is due for a major volume increase very, very soon. My thoughts are that either the price will increase this week gradually instead of all at once (so volume will be spread out) or we will see a sharp jump in volume this week or next week. Whatever way you look at it, it appears that some volume is due soon:

Still looking at the chart above, I also want to note IV (blue line in the volume subgraph). IV is still pretty damn low right now, which will make it easier for a gamma squeeze to happen. It's been decreasing pretty constantly for the past 2 months to pre-squeeze levels, so I would expect that when we see volume increase, we see an increase in IV as well.

Also, just want to note that today, we definitely saw a pretty major short attack around 12:30. Yes, the market seemed to go down around then too; however, GME and AMC both went down precipitously, which makes me believe that it wasn't just a normal sell-off.

Finally, this is probably the most important part of this DD. I plotted a 200-day exponential moving average (blue line) of GME to see what it looks like on a day timeframe, and it's definitely confirming the idea that each period is getting more and more expensive for them to cover. For those of you who don't understand EMAs, don't be worried about the price being so much lower than the actual candles, the price is supposed to be lower since it's period is 200, so just look at the trend:

What's even more interesting is that when you take the exponential moving average, it's definitely starting to look more exponential than it is linear. It was looking linear up until January, which is where it seems to have gone more exponential, what's more important is that post-squeeze, it's continued that trend:

Future DD

Still haven't started any big future DD projects but I'm thinking that my next ones will be about trying to find smaller FTD cycles within GME based on different settlement times like T+2 and T+5. I will also probably try to decipher FTD numbers by reverse calculating them based on synthetic longs and ETF shorts, but that will take a long fucking time to do and will be difficult. So, stay tuned for those in the future.

That's it for today apes. As always, stay strong.
