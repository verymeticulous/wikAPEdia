Hello, this morning [u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) did a request in his synopsis to analyse all the Failure-To-Delivers contained in the ETFs. So I made a Python script where I get all the latest FTD data from the 72 ETFs including GME. I will from now on post the FTD data for you apes. I hope you guys enjoy it! 🦍🦍

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your kind words! Love you all! ❤ Have a nice weekend! 🍻
