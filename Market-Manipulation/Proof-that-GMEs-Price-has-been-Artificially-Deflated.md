Hello my fellow Apes 🦍🦍🦍,

For anyone with any lingering doubts about GME price being getting manipulated prepare to have your 🦍🧠🤯.

I am going to show some fairly definitive proof, using a measure called 'On-Balance Volume' which will show that all the downward price pressure has been with EXTREMELY minimal volumes.

You apes don't only have 💎✋ BUT ARE ALSO BUYING THE DIPS because total net buying volume has net INCRASED since January!

For me personally, this was the final piece of evidence I needed to feel certain about where this stock is going. 🚀🚀🚀

---------- BOILERPLATE:

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀

---------- On Balance Volume (OBV)

Before I 🤯 your mind, here is what OBV (On-Balance Volume) is all about:

> On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator, adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.

On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close and is negative when the close is below the prior close.

> The absolute number of the OBV does not matter, what does is the relative height of the line over time.

Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices.

This means, that if we see a significant decline in share price, we should also see a decrease in OBV line at a similar magnitude.

For my fellow 🤓, here is the equation:

---------- Examples of share price following OBV

Below I have 5 examples from other companies (AMD, Tesla, Cineplex, Royal Caribbean, Canopy) and all of them have OBV lines that very nicely go along with the share price.

Note: All data from TradingView (awesome app btw) and Period set to 1 day.

This is what the relationship between OBV and price should look like. In fact, the whole purpose of the OBV is that it actually can show when a price is about to move in a certain direction as you can see the spikes in OBV are all 1 to 2 periods before the share spikes.

---------- GME: When Share price doesn't follow OBV

And now let's get to GME.

-   Here you can see huge positive buy pressure from Jan 12 to 27, increasing by 462% with a share price increase of $305 ([VWAP - volume weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)).

-   Then the share price dropped by $264 (80%) from January 29 to Feb 4. If this was a real drop (i.e. people were actually selling their shares), we would expect a relative decrease in the buying pressure, however we only see it go down by 9%! 🤣🤣

-   When GME spiked in February, it actually gained more total positive buying pressure and surpassed the previous high point set on January 27!

-   It has only gone higher since. On March 10 & 12, we were at the highest level, 25% higher than January and even today, we are still 17% higher. This is also important because it showed that not much extra buy pressure was required to bring the price up from $40 to $300

THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL GET TO PROOF OF 💎✋! Almost no one actually sold during this period, or we would have seen a huge increase in negative buy pressure. If you just looked at the OBV, you would think that the stock price should be around $450-500

The red line is what I think the OBV SHOULD look like for the current stock price.

Note: This observations is true if you set the period to 1 week, 1 day, 4 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour

---------- TLDR

TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀

Stake: Shares in GME
